<h1 title="">BLACKIE THORNE AT
<br />CAMP LENAPE</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">TENT FOUR</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been working on the ra-a-ailroad</p>
<p class="t2">All the livelong day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Two enormous hay-wains, full and running
over with a tumbling mass of boys, turned
a bend in the narrow country road.</p>
<p>Blackie Thorne was the foremost boy on the
first wagon. He clambered up on the narrow seat
with so much eagerness to view the camp and the
lake that he almost knocked over the stolid farmer
who was driving the team. His first view of
camp!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>There it lay on the wooded slope above the
shining lake and the boat dock, a large white
lodge with a flag floating lazily above it, and two
rows of canvas tents lost among trees to the right
but showing clearly against the gray mountains
beyond, with their heavy covering of tall pines
sticking up like spikes along the skyline. Camp
Lenape, where the wonderful things his friends
told about had happened. Why, anything might
happen in such a marvelous place as the camp
which grew nearer every minute as the slow
horses plodded their way along the dusty road!</p>
<p>Blackie squirmed with excitement and jerked
his arm so that it hit the head of the driving
farmer and knocked his wide straw hat down over
his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here now, sonny!&rdquo; spluttered the man,
grabbing at his hat and almost falling off the
board which served as a seat. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a-goin&rsquo;
to get so het up about seein&rsquo; this camp-ground
of yourn, you better get out and walk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good idea!&rdquo; exclaimed a fellow standing
just behind Blackie, holding himself up in the
jolting wagon by a hand on Blackie&rsquo;s shoulder.
He was Gil Shelton, patrol-leader in Blackie&rsquo;s
troop back in the city, and a &ldquo;three-striper&rdquo; who
wore on his camp sweater three green chevrons to
show that he had been at Lenape for as many
seasons. &ldquo;What do you say, Blackie? If we
hop off now, we can follow the trail through the
woods and beat the rest into camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The trail led around the end of the lake, down
through a meadow dotted with daisies and buttercups,
and on again into the deepening shadow
of the pines and birches.</p>
<p>They panted as they ran up a short hill, and
came out in a little cleared space among the
scrub-pines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; gasped Blackie.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of killing ourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gil snorted. &ldquo;Does that little run make you
tired? Wait until you&rsquo;ve been here at camp a
week, and a trot like this will seem so slow you&rsquo;ll
think you&rsquo;re going backwards.&rdquo; Nevertheless he
stopped and threw himself on the soft ground,
and Blackie gratefully followed his example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far are we from camp now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, about a quarter of a mile, I guess. Don&rsquo;t
worry, little one, you&rsquo;ll get there before dark.&rdquo;
He pointed his grass-stem, toward the hills, where
the sun was dropping, a ball of red fire in the
west. &ldquo;The Indian council ring is over that
way. We&rsquo;ll have a pow-wow there to-morrow
night, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Blackie&rsquo;s eyes followed in the indicated direction,
but his attention was immediately claimed
by a fan-shaped formation of gray rocks on the
side of the western mountains. His dark eyebrows
raised, and he whistled. &ldquo;Hey, Gil,
what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That pile of rocks there&mdash;are they rocks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a terminal moraine. Now, ask me
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terminal moraine, dummy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, who put it there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; exclaimed Gil with disgust, &ldquo;if you
listened to the scoutmaster&rsquo;s talks instead of skylarking
around at troop meetings and stealing
Fat Crampton&rsquo;s hat, you&rsquo;d learn not to be so
ignorant. A terminal moraine is a pile of rocks
brought down by a glacier in the days when all
the part of the world north of here was covered
with ice. You&rsquo;ve heard of the Glacial Age,
haven&rsquo;t you? Well, when the ice moved down
from the North Pole it pushed a lot of rocks
ahead of it, right over the ground. Now, when
old Mr. Glacier got this far, he heard the five o&rsquo;clock
whistle blow or something, so he dropped
that pile of rocks he was carrying, and started to
melt. When we hike up there, you can see markings
on the rocks where they got scratched being
pulled along over the ground.&rdquo; Gil finished his
lecture by throwing away his chewed grass-stem
and carefully pulling another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Blackie rose and held up his hand to shade his
squinting eyes while he peered at the slide of
boulders which, according to Gil&rsquo;s story, had been
brought there in such a dramatic manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I believe you,&rdquo; he said; but he continued
to stare.</p>
<p>Half-hidden among the pines and mountain
maples, clinging to the side of the mountain at
the end of a thin line of road that ran above,
Blackie saw the faded clapboards and weathered
roof of a house. There was not a sign of life
about it. The sinking sun, nearing its last stand
above the Lenape ridge, was reflected in all its
bloodiness in two upstairs windows of that dark
and ominous dwelling; the afterglow swirled and
glinted with the color of molten copper. A little
breeze blew up from the lake, a breeze not too
warm for late June; and Blackie shivered slightly
as it struck his back. He didn&rsquo;t know why, but
the sight of that dead, hidden house scared him&mdash;just
a little. He thought it looked like a skull,
lost among the trees. There must be some mystery
about a house like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it now, youngster?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;Does anybody live in that old house up
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. That&rsquo;s where old Rattlesnake Joe
lives. Some people around here call him the
hermit. You can go up and see him some time.
Now, have you got your breath back? If we
don&rsquo;t get going pretty soon, the gang will be in
ahead of us, and we&rsquo;ll be out of luck for getting
a good bunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys trotted on along the trail at a
fast pace. Blackie would have liked to ask some
more questions about the hermit who lived alone
in the woods in that mysterious house, but he was
afraid that Gil would taunt him about being a
greenhorn, so he saved his breath for running.
The trail soon broke surprisingly into the
campus, and they were among white tents where
several of their comrades, already arrived in
camp by the same short-cut around the lake, were
busily spreading out their blankets on the two-decked
canvas bunks that lined the tent walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tent assignments must be already
posted,&rdquo; muttered Gil. &ldquo;Hurry up to the
lodge!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Blackie ran with him through the little tent-village,
but when he reached the flagpole before
the spreading lodge he halted as the lake and the
far shore spread out before his view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jee-miny!&rdquo; he whistled. He could see the
roof of the boat dock below, around which were
moored about a dozen broad-beamed steel rowboats.</p>
<p>Gil Shelton came tearing by, laden with blanket
and duffle that he had collected from the pile
of baggage on the lodge porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Blackie,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;you better get on
the job! You&rsquo;re assigned to Tent Four, down
there. Grab your stuff and hurry down. The
first one in the tent gets his choice of bunks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several boys, the advance guard of the hay-wagons,
came streaming down to the campus
from the road behind the lodge. Blackie climbed
the steps to the lodge porch and in the welter of
luggage there discovered a familiar-looking sea-bag
with his initials painted on it in black. Seizing
this dunnage, he ran stumbling to Tent Four,
his new home in the woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Tent Four lay at the end of the row of tents
topmost on the hilly campus. Before it lay a
cleared space dotted by huckleberry bushes and a
few shading pines. The tent was floored and
painted a battleship gray, and eight canvas bunks
lined the walls, running the length of the tent
and making two tiers. A tall boy was already
swiftly and smoothly making up a bed in one of
the lower bunks. He nodded to Blackie but did
not pause in his work.</p>
<p>Gil Shelton shouted across from Tent Three,
next door. His bunk was already made. With
the deftness of an experienced camper, he was
setting each thing in its correct place&mdash;shoes and
hats in a line under the bed, coats and sweaters
on the rope swung between the two tent-poles,
pajamas under his pillow, and the remainder of
his kit in one of the pine-wood lockers that ran
down the middle of the tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bottom bunks are the best, Blackie! If
you pick a top one, the fellow under you gets you
up in the morning by the airplane method!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie began unpacking his duffle, slowly and
clumsily. He laid out his blankets on a lower
bunk as advised, and tried two or three times to
make his result somewhat resemble Gil&rsquo;s bed; but
when he had finished, it still looked bumpy and
not too soft. Then he sat on his sea-bag and
looked about him helplessly.</p>
<p>The tall fellow, who had not spoken until now,
looked up and smiled shyly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stuck? Well, follow what I do, and you&rsquo;ll
soon get cleared up. This the first time you&rsquo;ve
been to camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first time Blackie had ever been
away from home, but he hated to admit it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. How do they put their stuff at <i>this</i>
camp?&rdquo; He said it as if he had visited all the
other camps in the world before he had happened
to drop in on this insignificant little one.</p>
<p>Two other boys now rushed down, and made
haste to stake out their claims to lower bunks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t have that one,&rdquo; warned the tall, quiet
boy to one of them who had put his bag on the
lower bunk nearest the lodge. &ldquo;That belongs to
the councilor. And a councilor needs a lower
bunk because he may have to turn out quick in
the middle of the night if he&rsquo;s needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the councilor?&rdquo; asked the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rawn&mdash;Wally. He&rsquo;s the fellow that has
charge of the swimming. Well, I&rsquo;m going up to
the lodge. He promised to let me be the waiter
for the first two days, because I know all about
it.&rdquo; He departed in the direction of the lodge.</p>
<p>Blackie sat on his bunk and looked around.
Everyone was busily engaged in making up the
first night&rsquo;s bed, and shouts and singing came
from all quarters as the busy campers shook
down in their new homes. From the lodge porch
came the brazen blare of First Call sounded by
the camp bugler.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>A pine bough brushed against the tent, laden
with cones. It occurred to Blackie that it would
be a good idea to take a few and stick them in
between someone&rsquo;s blankets. He lifted off a few
that looked to be the most prickly and crossing
the tent, pulled down the blankets of the tall lad
who had gone to the lodge. The two other boys
had now been joined by a third; but none of them
were watching, for they were hurriedly preparing
for supper, and evidently thought the bunk
was his own.</p>
<p>Blackie shoved the pine-cones down between
the blankets, and looked around to see if anyone
had watched him. Someone had. A shadow fell
across the front of the tent, a tall and muscular
figure stood over him, and a deep voice demanded,
&ldquo;Do you always sleep with pine-cones
in your bed?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">THE COUNCILOR</span></h2>
<p>Blackie hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I always do that when I&rsquo;m
camping. It makes it seem more as if I was
really in the woods,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The tall man&mdash;he must have been six feet two,
and stockily built&mdash;looked down at Blackie and
frowned. He was big enough to have picked up
the boy and used him for a baseball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t lie if I were you,&rdquo; he drawled.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad habit for a young lad to acquire.
That bunk belongs to Ken Haviland, my aide.
By the time he&rsquo;s ready to crawl in to-night, he&rsquo;ll
be plenty tired from a long day on the job. Don&rsquo;t
you think he&rsquo;s entitled to a good sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since we are to be tent-mates, we ought
to get acquainted.&rdquo; He grinned broadly, and
held out his hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Wally Rawn. What&rsquo;s
your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackie. Blackie Thorne.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The man grinned as he took the boy&rsquo;s hand in
a firm grip and surveyed the bright black eyes,
the shining black hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bad name, at that. What&rsquo;s your
mother call you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She calls me Blackie, too. My regular name
is Ambrose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell a soul. Blackie you are and
Blackie you shall be. Now, Blackie, I&rsquo;m going
to offer you a chance to show what sort of a spirit
you have for helping to make the Tent Four boys
known all over camp. I have, after much
thought, decided to paint our tent-poles with
pink and green stripes. That ought to start the
rest of camp thinking about us. Now, please run
up to the kitchen and ask the chef to send you
down here with a bucket of striped paint&mdash;pink
and green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie was off like a flash, but his leader
called him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you&rsquo;re up there, Blackie, you can also
ask him to lend you a bunk-stretcher. I find that
my feet stick out over the edge of my berth, and
I don&rsquo;t want to wake up in the morning and find
the birds roosting on my toes. A left-handed
bunk-stretcher&mdash;my bunk is on the left-hand
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Rawn.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;Call me Wally. Now, off with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie bounded up the short hill to the side
door of the kitchen. Through the screen came
the tantalizing fragrance of something good; supper
was on the way, evidently, and Ellick, that
good-hearted king of the kitchen, was at his busiest.
Blackie pushed open the door and ran in
with an important look on his dark face. He was
greeted by Leggy, a skinny, coffee-colored individual
whose thin shanks, although they seemed
to have no end, did no more than reach the
ground. He waved a long-handled spoon, and
made a swing with it at Blackie&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outside, white boy!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Kitchen
ain&rsquo;t no place for little boys at de supper-call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got a message for the chef&mdash;very important.
Let me in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hol&rsquo; on dere!&rdquo; came Ellick&rsquo;s voice from the
far corner of the room. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t de boy what
is lookin&rsquo; for de striped paint, is you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am, chef.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if dat don&rsquo;t beat all!&rdquo; exclaimed the
surprised cook. &ldquo;We is just out of striped paint.
If I wasn&rsquo;t busily pre-incapacitated by carving
dis yere ham for dinner, now, I would shorely
help you-all out. A left-handed bunk-stretcher
wouldn&rsquo;t do as well, would it, now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that was the other thing I was sent
for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who-all sent you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wally Rawn&mdash;he&rsquo;s my leader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that Wally boy! It must shore be important
then. If I could only dis-extricate myself
from carvin&rsquo; dis yere ham, now&mdash;&mdash;Let
me see. De bestest thing to do under de concircumstances
is for you-all to go down to de boat
dock and petitionate de person in charge to give
you de keys to de campus. And, whiles you&rsquo;m
down there, you-all might bring up a cargo
what&rsquo;s waitin&rsquo; for some smart young boy to
fetch me. Ask him pussonally from me to deliver
unto you-all de shipment of fence-post
holes and de Royal Official Back-Scratcher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet, chef&mdash;keys to the campus, fencepost
holes and the Royal Official Back-Scratcher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thanks you. What might be you-all
name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm. I decalculate from dat name dat you
are repartial to doughnuts.&rdquo; There was a sweet,
sugary smell in the warm kitchen air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doughnuts? You said it, chef!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>The grinning Ellick deftly caught up a doughnut
from a bowl beside him, and tossed it in the
air. Blackie got under it like a veteran fielder,
and sped out the door. The gangling Leggy
aimed a parting swing at him with the long-tailed
spoon, and missed.</p>
<p>On the parade ground, Blackie paused in his
headlong lakeward course at the sight of Gil
Shelton, hair combed, face shining from a recent
scrubbing, and spotless for supper. &ldquo;Hey,
Blackie, where you heading? After fence-post
holes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep&mdash;how did you know? And striped paint
and a left-handed bunk-stretcher and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gil started in great surprise. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo;
he exclaimed, &ldquo;that they picked you to bring
the Royal Official Back-Scratcher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sure have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great honor, my son. In fact, only
the newest and greenest boys are ever picked for
it. Say, Blackie, I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d fall for
that old stuff. Did you ever see a fence-post
hole? Does striped paint come in cans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie paused and thought for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Gil, it was my leader Wally who sent
me. He told me not to tell lies, too, so I thought
it was all right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, did you ever hear of Santa Claus?
Why, for a week now the little, new, green,
smart, bright city boys will be looking all over
the place for striped paint and the key to the
lake. And you fell for it the first thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gil&rsquo;s laughter was so deep that Blackie was
glad to get back to the shelter of his tent.</p>
<p>Wally greeted him. &ldquo;So you didn&rsquo;t find it,
eh? Well, that&rsquo;s all right&mdash;don&rsquo;t be discouraged.
You can help me out in another way. Just run
down to the dock, will you, and ask if anyone
down there has seen the key to the lake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life, Wally,&rdquo; grinned Blackie.
&ldquo;Send one of the new fellows down, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The camp bugler, Ted Fellowes, sounded Assembly
Call at that moment, and there was no
time for further talk before supper. After the
Retreat ceremony and the lowering of the flag,
the boys attacked the supper that had been prepared
in the depths of the kitchen. Blackie had
never found a meal that tasted quite so good.</p>
<p>He met the remainder of the boys of Tent
Four at the table. Ken Haviland, the tent aide,
was busily serving as waiter at one end; he had to
run again and again to the serving window for
additional platters of ham, potatoes, and turnips,
mountains of bread and oceans of milk.
Blackie didn&rsquo;t envy him his job.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Wally had evidently met all the boys in his
group. He paused and, between mouthfuls, addressed
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s worrying me, gentlemen
of the famous Tent Four group. There are
only seven of us, and there should be eight,
counting myself. One of our number has not
turned up. I shall call our imposing roll. Haviland!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, sir.&rdquo; Ken seized his serving tray and
dashed off in pursuit of dessert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thorne! Here, I see. Slater!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, sir!&rdquo; answered a freckle-faced boy
with burning red hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guppy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie looked with interest at the boy with
such a beautiful name. He was a little chap of
about eleven, at the end of one row.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lefkowitz!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Present!&rdquo; came a squeaky voice from across
the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gallegher!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; He was a sunburnt, black-haired
chap with a scar across his forehead, shaped like
a V.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Crampton! No answer. It is the notorious
Mr. Crampton who is missing. Has anybody
here ever heard tell of the gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be Fat,&rdquo; said Blackie. &ldquo;We saw
him down at the end of the lake before we hiked
up. He was in the wagon then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s the fat fellow we dumped off
the wagon coming along the road back of camp,&rdquo;
volunteered Slater. &ldquo;We told him that walking
was the best way to reduce his figger, and
dumped him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To our fat friend&rsquo;s rescue, then, tent-mates!&rdquo;
cried Wally, drinking down the last of
a glass of milk. &ldquo;As soon as the Chief makes his
announcements, we shall be in the saddle and off
for the hunt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A whistle sounded, and quiet fell on the
groups. The Chief was about to speak. He
rose, an imposing figure of a man, quiet, dignified,
and with a voice full of calm command. He
was dressed in camper&rsquo;s togs, and wore the green
&ldquo;L&rdquo; on his sweater.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;All I have to say is this, fellows. We are
all up here for a good time&mdash;the best time ever.
Now, I want to mention a few things that will
help the new camper to get along and make himself
at home. Don&rsquo;t expose yourselves to the sun
too much until you get a coat of tan gradually;
you won&rsquo;t blister then. Don&rsquo;t cut up or mark the
trees on the campus of which we are so proud.
Don&rsquo;t have any firearms in your tents; none of
any kind are permitted here at camp, and if you
have any, bring them up to the lodge and I will
look after them for you. And finally, I only
need mention the rule we have about boys who
smoke. Now, those are all the &lsquo;don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
going to mention. In an hour there will be a
grand jubilee campfire below the baseball diamond,
where I will introduce you to the councilors,
who will then have something to say to
you. All set for the best camp season ever!
Everybody happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; The resounding, united call of the
campers reverberated among the lodge rafters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the lions roar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rao-a-ow!&rdquo; A pack of well-fed lions never
sent up such a tremendous roaring to the Sahara
moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dismissed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tent Four remained a little island in the swirling
rush of campers that broke up after the meal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you with me, gang?&rdquo; shouted Wally.
&ldquo;Onward to the rescue of our wandering
brother!&rdquo; He made for the back door, pushing
through the crowd like a fullback carrying the
ball to victory, followed by his eager team of
tent-mates. Tent Four was on the round-up.</p>
<p>No sooner had they reached the road behind
camp than the leader began giving directions,
curtly and with precision. &ldquo;Spread out, fellows,
and we&rsquo;ll cover a path on each side of the road.
Keep in touch with my whistle&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be in the
center. Shout for Crampton at intervals, and
we&rsquo;ll soon have him back in the fold&mdash;&mdash;What&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A low moan was heard behind him, just off the
road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wally bounded off in the direction from
whence it came. His muscular legs cleared the
low bushes like so many hurdles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behind that big tree!&rdquo; shouted Gallegher.
The six boys dashed off after their leader, and
found him staring down at a mournful figure
sitting with his back to the trunk of a tall pine.
It was Fat Crampton. His bulging cheeks bore
the trails of tear-marks; he sat hunched amid the
wreckage of his knapsack and accouterment, with
the most woebegone look in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m lost in the woods,&rdquo; he moaned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been walking around for hours!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you poor nut,&rdquo; said Blackie, &ldquo;if you
had walked two steps further you would have
tripped over the camp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fat transferred his doleful gaze. &ldquo;Oh,
Blackie, is it really you? Say, I&rsquo;m scared. I
heard a bunch of lions off in the woods a minute
ago, and I thought they were going to get me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lions, nothing!&rdquo; The whole tent broke into
a storm of laughter. &ldquo;That was us! Rao-a-ow!
Look out for us, Fat&mdash;we&rsquo;re lions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, lion-hunter,&rdquo; said Wally, &ldquo;come
on and get a meal of raw meat. I think the chef
will have saved something for you.&rdquo; He lifted
the rotund lad on his shoulder and set off toward
the kitchen, with Fat helplessly waving his arms
from his lofty perch. The rest of the boys ran
with them, roaring terribly and making quips at
the wanderer&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p>Little Guppy ran beside Wally, looking up at
the leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make up Fat&rsquo;s bunk,&rdquo; he offered, &ldquo;if he&rsquo;ll
tell me where his blankets are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit! Keep it up, and you&rsquo;ll
make a great aide some day, Gup!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>By the time the fat boy was fed, the bugle
sounded Assembly for the campfire. It was now
dark, and the campers found their ways down
through the baseball diamond to a field above the
lake shore, where a group of three or four leaders
were standing beside a high pyre of logs and
branches, talking to the Chief. They were Mr.
Frayne, the burly assistant director whom everyone,
even the smallest boys, familiarly called
&ldquo;Happy Face&rdquo; because of the smile he always
wore; &ldquo;Sax&rdquo; McNulty, the mournful-looking
comedian and saxophone artist who had charge
of the shows and stunt-nights; and Lieutenant
Eames, the West Pointer. The other leaders
were to be found among the crowd of boys settling
around the piled fire.</p>
<p>In the glow of somebody&rsquo;s flashlight Blackie
caught sight of Gil Shelton&rsquo;s face in the crowd.
Gil saw him, also, and shouted over: &ldquo;Hi,
Blackie! How&rsquo;s the guardian of the Royal Official
Back-Scratcher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, forget it, Gil. Say, what are they going
to do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light the fire, of course. Then I guess we&rsquo;ll
have a song or two, and the Chief will introduce
all the leaders, and somebody will tell a story, and
then we&rsquo;ll burn all the little new greenhorns at
the stake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Blackie laughed as much as the joke required,
and snuggled down next to Wally, in the midst
of the Tent Four group. The fire was lighted,
and the glow was reflected in the faces of the
happy throng of campers who gathered around
the first campfire of the season. The boys of
Tent Four, already bound together by loyalty
to their leader, were content to lie and listen to
the calm voice of their Chief, as a spout of flaring
sparks rose from the flames to challenge the distant
glitter of the stars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">AFTER TAPS</span></h2>
<p>The musical echo of Tattoo came from the
bugle, and a hush fell upon Tent Four.
The campfire still smouldered in the field by the
lake, but the campers had passed to their tents
at the Call to Quarters, and were now making
ready to turn in for the night.</p>
<p>Blackie squatted on his bunk and stared at the
faces that were half-illuminated by the solitary
lantern that hung on the tent-pole. Mindful of
the pine-cones that were still in Ken Haviland&rsquo;s
bed, he was lying low and watching for developments.</p>
<p>The aide had already stripped, and was climbing
into a swathing suit of pajamas. Above him
jutted the head of Lefkowitz, already between
blankets but still full of interest in proceedings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find my nightgown,&rdquo; wailed little
Guppy at the other end of the tent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;It should be under your pillow,&rdquo; said Wally.
He stretched his broad arms and yawned prodigiously,
making a noise like an enraged walrus.
&ldquo;You ought to have pajamas anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put it under the pillow, sir, as Ken told me
to. I had an extra one, but that&rsquo;s gone too. And
I promised Mother I wouldn&rsquo;t sleep in my&mdash;my
underthings, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;ll probably turn up. For to-night
you can have an extra pair of my pajamas. I
think the pants would be enough for you, though&mdash;you&rsquo;re
not exactly a giant.&rdquo; Wally produced
a pair of outing-flannel pants, stuffed the small
Guppy into the legs of them, tied the cord about
his neck, and stowed him away between the
blankets like a sack of potatoes.</p>
<p>Ken was turning down the covers. Blackie
watched him feel the blankets all over, and to the
joker&rsquo;s disappointment, the aide touched several
suspicious bumps and resuscitated the hidden
pine-cones. He tossed them into the night, and
winked at Blackie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My camp experience has taught me to always
feel my bed before I turn in,&rdquo; he grinned.
&ldquo;Some chaps have a funny sense of humor.&rdquo; He
hopped in and sprawled out luxuriously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Now that his trap had failed, Blackie bethought
him of turning in also. Slater, who had
been outside gazing at the stars, stepped into the
tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of meteorites falling to-night, sir,&rdquo; he
observed. &ldquo;Venus is full, too, I think; she&rsquo;s
especially bright in the west.&rdquo; He set about his
preparations for bed.</p>
<p>Gallegher made a spring and landed in his
bunk, just over Blackie&rsquo;s head. A creaking from
another upper bunk across the way announced
that Fat Crampton had at last been able to climb
to his lofty berth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it fast, Blackie,&rdquo; warned the leader.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to be the last one in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie was soon arrayed in the popular evening
clothes for the well-dressed camper, and
looked longingly at his inviting bunk. He
slipped between the warm blankets, and
stretched out. Umm&mdash;this was the life!</p>
<p>But hold on! Something had him by the leg&mdash;something
else was biting him on the foot!
Ouch! He yelled and rolled over the side, to
come to the floor in a whirling pile of boy, blankets,
and&mdash;pine-cones!</p>
<p>Gallegher snickered above him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The oldest trick there is!&rdquo; he chuckled.
&ldquo;These new guys will fall for anything!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>The crestfallen Blackie struggled upright, and
in the dull lamplight began to make his bed anew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be all the demonstrations of playfulness
for to-night, gentlemen,&rdquo; observed Wally,
sitting on the edge of his bunk. &ldquo;You are all
tired, and need your sleep&mdash;I, may it be observed,
need mine also. How anybody has the pep left
to skylark around the first night of camp&mdash;or
any other night&mdash;is beyond me. As soon as Taps
sounds, Tent Four will be as still as the grave.
The silence, as the book-writers always have it,
will be broken only by the measured breathing
of the slumbering woodsmen and the far call of
a fillyloo bird across the waste. Key down, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reached for his kit and drew out a book.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking seriously now. We are all up here
at Lenape to have the best time ever. It&rsquo;s my
job as councilor to see that we do. And that&rsquo;s
what I want to make you fellows understand.
I&rsquo;ll help you in any way I can to keep you good
campers and to make Lenape proud of you. If
at any time you have anything on your mind,
bring it to me and we&rsquo;ll talk it out. Now, I&rsquo;m
going to read you one of the finest things that a
camper ever listened to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>He opened the Bible in his hand and read by
the flickering light, in a clear and sincere voice:
&ldquo;The heavens declare the glory of God; and the
firmament sheweth his handywork. Day unto
day uttereth speech, and night unto night
sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor language
where their voice is not heard. Their line
is gone out through all the earth, and their words
to the end of the world. In them hath He set a
tabernacle for the sun, which is as a bridegroom
coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a
strong man to run a race. His going forth is
from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto
the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the
heat thereof. The law of the Lord is perfect,
converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord
is sure, making wise the simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Softly and sweetly, as if from afar, came the
first comforting notes of Taps, the finest of music
to a tired camper. Wally doused the lantern,
and the glory of the stars came into the quiet
tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, fellows,&rdquo; said Wally quietly.
&ldquo;Happy dreams!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie lay quite still in his tumbled bed,
thinking about the stars. Firmament&mdash;that was
a word that meant the same as heaven, but not so
nice-sounding. The stars were bright, all right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Gallegher must have put those cones into his
bed, when he had been chasing bunk-stretchers&mdash;it
must have been Gallegher, because he had
laughed so hard when Blackie fell out. Well,
so much the worse for Mr. Gallegher! He was
sleeping right above Blackie, and in the morning,
Mr. Gallegher would be surprised. He reached
up one foot, tentatively, to see how the airplane
method would work in helping Gallegher to rise.
The temptation came, and he pushed upward
with both feet, hard.</p>
<p>Zoom! Gallegher flew into the air and came
down to the floor with a wild yell. The experiment
was a success. Tent Four was instantly
alert.</p>
<p>Lefkowitz snickered. Slater moaned dolefully.
Little Guppy said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gallegher lay tumbled on the floor among his
blankets. He had bruised his elbow against a
locker, and it made him mean-tempered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get even&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the dark came the calm voice of
Wally. &ldquo;You seem to have been around a bunch
of pretty foul-mouthed fellows, Gallegher. Gentlemen,
and especially Lenape gentlemen, don&rsquo;t
talk that way. Chain gang for you Monday
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; shouted Gallegher. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say
it again if he did that to me. If Blackie was a
gentleman, he wouldn&rsquo;t have given me that airplane
ride. It&rsquo;s his fault as much as mine. Why
don&rsquo;t you give him the chain gang, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Blackie, chuckling happily to
himself at the thought of the row he had raised,
sat up and leaned on one arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I ask you and the other fellows to
key down after Taps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Take your blankets and go sleep
on the ground by the flagpole to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why? I didn&rsquo;t do a thing but get back
at him for sticking pine-cones in my bunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On your way. When you can behave decently,
you can sleep with the rest of us again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sullenly, and making as much noise about it as
he dared, Blackie put on his slippers and gathered
up his pillow and blankets over his arm.
The night air was cool, and he shivered slightly
in his pajamas. A pine tree&rsquo;s branch brushed the
canvas tent-roof above his head, and somewhere
off up the mountain a dog howled dismally. It
didn&rsquo;t look too inviting out on the darkened
campus by the flagpole; but he didn&rsquo;t want to
appear a coward and whine to get out of going.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, you guys,&rdquo; he said with bravado
and stalked out of the rear of the tent. As he
passed the bunk across from the leader&rsquo;s, on his
way out, Slater stuffed something among
Blackie&rsquo;s blankets with a whispered caution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep it out of sight&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got the chance
to get to the flagpole!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie nodded and went out on the path. The
stars were like bright candles against a blue-green
silk dome, and somehow their twinkling was not
so pleasant now. He passed a line of tents, some
quiet, one or two filled with low snickers and
cackles and the usual disturbance of the first night
under canvas. The white lodge showed pale and
strange in the starlight; the campus was somehow
changed from what it had been in bright day.
He stumbled across to the base of the flagpole
and began spreading out his bed on the hard
ground. He cleared away one or two stones,
and beat down the high grass as best he could,
and tried to rearrange his blankets into comfortable
shape.</p>
<p>His next care was to examine the bundle that
Slater had passed to him. As he had guessed, it
was the missing nightgown that Guppy had bewailed
at bedtime. He chuckled, thinking of the
scheme that Slater had suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>He looked around; the coast was clear. The
flagpole was only a few steps away. He
jumped up, unfastened the halyards, and knotting
a sleeve to each end of the rope, hauled
away. Then, almost too sleepy to care where
he lay, he crawled into his twisted bed and was
dead to the world in half a minute, smiling to
think that when the morning sun rose over
Camp Lenape, it would reveal that the campers
had slept under a fluttering ensign that was nothing
more than little Guppy&rsquo;s pink nightgown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">A HARD CASE</span></h2>
<p>Blackie was wakened somewhat rudely the
next morning. A sloshing glass of cold
water landed on his face, and he jumped up half-awake
to find Gil Shelton standing over him in
the fresh sunlight with the empty glass in his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rise and shine!&rdquo; called the patrol-leader.
&ldquo;First Call will sound in about a minute. Gee,
you must have been sawing wood not to hear the
noise the gang has been making ever since four
o&rsquo;clock this morning! Most of the tenderfeet
woke up early and have been horsing around. I
couldn&rsquo;t sleep, so Chink Towner and Spaghetti
Megaro and I got permission to hike down to the
cottage and back. Look at the big frog we found
by the brook!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held up a monstrous bullfrog by the hind
legs, so close to Blackie&rsquo;s face that he jumped
backwards in alarm, while Gil&rsquo;s two companions
laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him scare you,&rdquo; said Megaro, the
Italian boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t afraid. Say, what are you going to
do with him, Gil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him to Ellick&mdash;he likes to eat frog legs.
Come on, here comes Fellowes with his tin horn
ready to blow First Call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie picked up his bed and made his way
to Tent Four. All his tent-mates were awake
and laughing at little Guppy, who had just discovered
that his nightgown was floating in the
breeze at the top of the flagpole. The bugle&rsquo;s
call routed them all out to formation in front of
the lodge, where after a snappy setting-up drill
the entire camp flew down the slope to the boat
dock for the Indian dip.</p>
<p>The blue waters of the lake reflected a hundred
white bodies standing about the edge of the
dock waiting for Wally&rsquo;s whistle. No sooner
had it sounded than there was a tremendous
plunging and splashing as most of them tumbled
head-first into the crisp, bracing water. A few
younger boys and timid souls waded in from the
shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stick your head under, Toots!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, boy! Say, ain&rsquo;t this water cold?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t cold, you dummy. Just the way I
like it&mdash;wakes me up fine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie took a swift racing dive off the front
end of the dock, swept cleanly through the water
in a shower of small bubbles, and came to the surface
with a speedy overhand stroke. He swam
some fifty yards out to the life-saving boat that
was stationed there with Sax McNulty at the
oars and a leader named Munson at the bow, and
there floated a minute. He was surprised to hear
the trill of the whistle, followed by cries of &ldquo;All
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swimming over to the dock again, he shouted
in a grieved tone to Wally, who was supervising
the general exodus from the water, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the idea, Wally? Do you call this a swim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not&mdash;this is just morning dip, and
you&rsquo;ll get a chill if you stay in long. Swim comes
later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, heck!&rdquo; Somewhat disgruntled, he
climbed out and raced back to the tent to dress
for breakfast.</p>
<p>The morning meal over, there was a period of
duty. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re on police squad, you fellows!&rdquo;
called Ken Haviland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police?&rdquo; asked Blackie. &ldquo;What do we do&mdash;go
around arresting guys?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, you sap. Get a blanket and I&rsquo;ll show
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie discovered that policing camp merely
meant going about the campus and picking up
bits of paper and destroying unsightly objects
that littered the paths. Church Call sounded
soon after they finished, and together with the
rest of the campers he went to a shady glade in
the forest beside the lake and sat on a log while
the short Sunday service was held. He liked sitting
there in the leafy woods and singing the various
tunes, even though they were the same ones
they sang in Sunday-school at home; he admired
the handiwork of the rustic pulpit that the campers
had built the year before; but when the Chief
began his talk he was frankly bored. The Chief
was saying something about different trees and
how they were like different kinds of boys; but
Blackie only listened now and then. He was
wishing that church was over and that they could
go in swimming again; and he passed the time
catching ants and dropping them down the neck
of a smaller boy who sat in front of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>As a matter of fact the service was quite brief;
but it seemed to him that it would never end.
After years of waiting, or so he thought, the
brisk challenge of Swim Call came from the lodge
porch, and slipping into his bathing suit, he
headed again for the dock. He was the first one
there, with the exception of the life-saving crew,
composed equally of councilors and older boys
who had won the Red Cross emblem that was
stitched over their breasts. Wally was in charge;
he was sending out three boats to patrol the
waters about the dock and posting the guards
who would stand in various places about the
tower to be on the watch for water accidents.
When this was done, the man turned to Blackie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First one down for swim? Say, if you&rsquo;d only
show as much speed doing squad-duty, the rest
of the fellows wouldn&rsquo;t have to do a thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I go in now, Wally?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to hold yourself down until the
rest get here and the whistle blows. The rule is
that there&rsquo;s no swimming except when the life-savers
are on duty. There aren&rsquo;t going to be any
accidents while I&rsquo;m in charge. By the way, I noticed
this morning at Indian dip that you&rsquo;re not a
bad swimmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty good, I guess,&rdquo; said Blackie modestly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the Australian crawl? No?
Well, if you want to make speed, that&rsquo;s the stroke
to use. The camp always holds a big boat regatta
and swimming meet at the end of each section&mdash;that&rsquo;s
two weeks from now&mdash;and we compete
with our old rivals of Camp Shawnee. I&rsquo;d like
to see you take a few honors and help us to beat
them. What say I teach you the crawl some
time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, maybe. Well, here comes the
gang!&rdquo; He turned away as the crowd of campers,
all in swimming togs, trooped on to the dock,
and at the sound of his whistle the swim began.</p>
<p>Blackie sported about the water happily for
the remainder of the period. He was quite
pleased with himself for having thus been singled
out by his leader for swimming ability. Tired of
circling about the life-boats, he began ducking
less experienced swimmers and pushing boys off
the dock into the water, until he was reprimanded
for this conduct by Lieutenant Eames because
of the danger of someone slipping and injuring
himself against one of the piles or the superstructure
of the dock. This scolding made him sulky,
and he swam by himself until the whistle blew,
and then tardily walked up to the tent, stopping
many times on the way to chase butterflies or to
hunt for snakes among the rocks; and thus, when
he finally reached the tent, he found his comrades
working busily. All the beds were made except
his own, and under the direction of Ken Haviland,
the boys were sweeping and arranging,
cleaning the tent lantern, putting their lockers in
order, and tidying up the place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; the aide greeted him.
&ldquo;Snap out of it and get dressed and make your
bunk and get ready for inspection. Wally had
to go up to leaders&rsquo; meeting at the lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, don&rsquo;t make such a fuss,&rdquo; said Blackie.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it, won&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we have only a couple minutes
before inspection. If the tent isn&rsquo;t in apple-pie
order, we don&rsquo;t stand a chance to win the pennant
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what if we don&rsquo;t? What&rsquo;s the good of
having an old pennant in front of your tent? It
don&rsquo;t get you anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you see it means that the Tent
Four bunch are the best campers? When you&rsquo;re
here longer you&rsquo;ll learn not to waste time talking
back when we have a chance to show our
stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Without haste, Blackie peeled off his swimming
suit and cast it on the floor, dressed with
tantalizing slowness, and with a scowl at the aide,
began to make his bed. He knew that Haviland
was angry and thought it a good chance to get
the tall camper&rsquo;s &ldquo;goat.&rdquo; In the midst of his
preparations the call came down the line, &ldquo;All
out of tents for inspection!&rdquo; Haviland and the
others jumped outside and lined up at attention,
but Blackie delayed to try and shake his blankets
into shape. Just as he stepped outside, Mr.
Colby, one of the councilors and a scoutmaster
known for his strictness, came along with his inspection
staff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tent Four! Two demerits for having a
camper inside the tent after inspection call. The
tent seems to be in pretty good shape, but there&rsquo;s
a wet bathing suit in the middle of the floor, and
one bunk that isn&rsquo;t made. Sorry, Haviland&mdash;but
this will give you so many demerits that you&rsquo;ll
probably get the booby prize to-day! Any
excuse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No excuse, sir,&rdquo; answered Haviland, looking
daggers at the guilty Blackie. After the inspection
crew had passed on, he turned to Blackie
and said, &ldquo;We would have had a good chance
at the pennant if it hadn&rsquo;t been for you! As it
is, we&rsquo;ll probably have the booby can tied to our
tent-pole until to-morrow! What do you say,
fellows&mdash;shall I recommend that Wally puts him
on the chain gang?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Put me on the gang if you want to&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
care!&rdquo; exclaimed Blackie boldly; but he was
silent all during dinner, and even fried chicken,
green corn and ice-cream failed to make him
forget that his careless attitude had won him the
black looks of all his tent-mates.</p>
<p>After the meal there was the usual siesta
period. The boys were scattered about lying in
their bunks, resting and writing letters home.
Blackie crouched in his place with a pencil and
pad before him. Haviland sat across from him,
now and then looking gloomily up at a big tin
can, painted black with the white letters BOOBY
across it, which hung swinging in plain sight over
the front steps. Slater was writing busily. Fat
Crampton was asleep, and Gallegher was tickling
the stout boy&rsquo;s nose and neck with a stalk of
grass, while Guppy and Lefkowitz watched the
proceedings with amusement.</p>
<p>Blackie looked down at what he had written.
&ldquo;Dear Mother&mdash;We got here O. K. and Camp
Lenape is a fine camp. I am on the Chain Gang
already and the swimming is O. K. I will learn
the Ostralien crawl soon please send me up some
fudge and cake. Last night I slep out-door.
I think this is a fine camp o boy and don&rsquo;t forget
the fudge and cake and some chewing gum too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>He read this over for the fifth time, wondered
what to put down next, and looked up to find
Haviland watching him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s biting you?&rdquo; Blackie asked. &ldquo;Still
sore because you didn&rsquo;t win your old pennant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not myself I&rsquo;m worrying about, but after
dinner I heard a couple of the other leaders
kidding Wally because he is always so proud of
having his tent make a good showing, and to-day
we were handed the merry razz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie snorted. &ldquo;Say, who is this guy Wally
that he should boss us around? Always blowing
his whistle just when the water&rsquo;s getting good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; put in Gallegher, who had finally
succeeded in awakening Fat Crampton. &ldquo;Down
our way all the guys would think he was sure a
sissy, landin&rsquo; on me just because I cussed a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t give me seconds on ice-cream,
either,&rdquo; said Fat Crampton mournfully. &ldquo;Said
I ought to start to reduce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ken looked at them all pityingly. &ldquo;Say, don&rsquo;t
you know Wally is a senior at Columbia University
and on the varsity water-polo and basketball
teams? He&rsquo;s coming up here and spending his
time teaching you birds how to be good campers,
and that&rsquo;s all the thanks he gets!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he has a pretty good time,&rdquo; said
Blackie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he does, or he wouldn&rsquo;t be here.
But it&rsquo;s no fun to have a tent full of lazy draw-backs
like you that object every time he tries to
make a good showing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a short space of silence. Slater
looked up from his writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Ken, do we have council ring to-night?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s council ring?&rdquo; asked Blackie curiously.</p>
<p>Slater explained. &ldquo;Just when it&rsquo;s getting
dark, we all put on blankets and go over to
council, just like the Indians used to do. We all
sit in a circle around a four-square fire, and one
of the fellows lights the fire with flint and steel,
or else with rubbing-sticks. Then we have report
of scouts. Any fellow who has seen any interesting
birds or animals or anything like that gets up
and tells about them. Then we suggest anything
we can do to help make the camp better and
offer to do it. Then they have all kinds of contests&mdash;hand-wrestling
and talk-fests and imitations,
and usually end up with a ghost story. It&rsquo;s
real fun, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Blackie remembered that Gil had pointed out
the way to the council ring the evening before,
and suddenly thought he would like to see the
place by daylight. He put away his letter, rose,
and stretched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long, you guys,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked the aide.
&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s allowed to leave until after Recall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of your business&mdash;and if you ask me,
I think you&rsquo;re nothing but a spy on us for this
Wally of yours.&rdquo; He dived into the bushes and
disappeared before Haviland could follow.</p>
<p>Not only did he want the fun of tormenting
Ken, but also wishing to look over the famous
council ring, he took a course through the woods
that he thought would bring him out at the place
he sought. It was quiet; the camp was still even
for a Sunday afternoon. He pressed through
the underbrush and in a short time stumbled
upon a well-worn path that led in the direction
he was going. Shortly he caught a glimpse of
white birch railings through the leaves, and he
trod softly in case there should be anyone there
who might question him. His precaution proved
to be wise. From a clearing ahead came the low
hum of men&rsquo;s voices.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>A circle some fifty yards across had been
cleared in the woods, and seats built about it,
with an imposing stone dais on the north side to
furnish a proper elevation for the chieftain.
Sitting on this stone were the Chief himself and
Wally Rawn, chatting together.</p>
<p>They had not seen him, and it struck Blackie
that it might be a daring thing to get close
enough to overhear their conference. Forgetful
of the old saying that eavesdroppers seldom hear
well of themselves, he wormed his way around
through the bushes and found a place where he
could listen without being seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I approve of the life-saving crew assignments
you&rsquo;ve made, then, Wally,&rdquo; the Chief was saying.
He rose as if to leave. &ldquo;By the way, what do
you think of the bunch I&rsquo;ve put in your tent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They look pretty good,&rdquo; answered Wally.
&ldquo;They ought to turn out first-rate after a couple
of days. Haviland is a pretty capable kid, and
Slater is bugs about stars and scouting and
doesn&rsquo;t give much trouble. That Crampton lad
is lazy, but I hope to have him get over that
when we get out on the hikes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have two fellows I put in with you because
they need pretty careful leadership. Know
who they are?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;Think I do, Chief&mdash;Gallegher and that
Blackie Thorne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. Gallegher comes from the worst part
of town, and I think he may have picked up a
lot of questionable habits. Thorne is a different
sort. He&rsquo;s lively and smart as a whip; but his
father is dead and maybe he&rsquo;s getting to be too
much for his mother to handle alone. He&rsquo;s full
of mischief, his scoutmaster tells me, but he ought
to turn out right. They&rsquo;re a pair of hard cases,
I guess; but keep them busy and they&rsquo;ll soon be
real Lenape fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like hard cases,&rdquo; grinned Wally. &ldquo;Blackie
is crazy about swimming; guess I can get him
interested through that, and the old camp spirit
is bound to follow. Well, let&rsquo;s get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men, arm in arm, disappeared down
the path. Blackie Thorne, in his hidden covert,
laughed unpleasantly at their backs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard case, am I?&rdquo; he said to himself.
&ldquo;Well, Mr. Smart Wally, if you call me that,
I guess all I can do is to try and live up to it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">TREASURE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;This chain gang ain&rsquo;t so bad,&rdquo; remarked
Gallegher.</p>
<p>It was after breakfast on Monday morning.
He and Blackie, as well as three other culprits,
were chopping wood behind the camp kitchen
with the supervision and assistance of Jim Avery,
a tall, gangling councilor who was a specialist in
woodcraft and bird-study.</p>
<p>Blackie split up a knotty stick of oak before
replying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, this ain&rsquo;t such hard work. The leader
does half of it, anyway. Say, you were pretty
good, to cuss right in front of Wally the other
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, that&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo;. I guess I&rsquo;m pretty
tough, all right. I used to go down by the railroad
lots of times and hook rides on the freight
cars. Once I bummed clear out to Scranton and
back, that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! No wonder the Chief said you was a
hard case!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Gallegher stopped his chopping, and looked up
proudly. &ldquo;Did he say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. I heard him talking to our noble
councilor about us. He said we were both hard
cases, and that Wally would have to watch us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s the way they do in this camp,
I&rsquo;m sure goin&rsquo; to get away with everything I
can. How about it&mdash;are you with me, Thorne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They split wood for a while in silence.
Blackie&rsquo;s back began to ache from stooping over
so much. He dropped his ax and stretched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, I&rsquo;m getting sick of this job. When
Jim lets us go, I&rsquo;m going to head for my bunk
and stay there the rest of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what did you come to camp for&mdash;to be
a bunk-stretcher?&rdquo; asked Gallegher. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
goin&rsquo; to have tests for the honor emblem this
mornin&rsquo;&mdash;ain&rsquo;t you goin&rsquo; to try for one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the honor emblem? What good is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, you have to pass a lot of tests, and then
they give you a badge to sew on your jersey.
You&rsquo;ve seen them&mdash;lots of the guys have won
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the things with a swastika and a
big L on them? What do you get for it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, don&rsquo;t be dumb all your life! If a guy
has an honor emblem he can join the Bugs
Society and have an initiation and a feed, and
then he can get away with lots of things, just
because he&rsquo;s got a badge, see? It&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; like
the Knights of Columbus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. What did you say you have to do to
get one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bunch of things, like knowin&rsquo; the names of
the parts of a boat and bein&rsquo; good at hikin&rsquo; and
swimmin&rsquo; and athaletics&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me. I can do all those things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;And collect flowers and tree leaves and
rocks, and know the names of the stars, and box
the compass, and cook a meal, and build cabins
and do stunts&mdash;a whole lot of stuff. We can do
it easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie considered this, and after his work was
done he joined a nature hike. During the hour
before swim, he learned much that he had not
previously known about geology and ferns, and
collected the ten leaves he must identify as one
of the qualifications toward his honor emblem.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Since overhearing Wally and the Chief in the
council ring, his attitude toward his leader had
changed. He now thought of Wally as an
irksome guardian and taskmaster, and found
excuses for himself to disagree with every suggestion
the councilor made. Nevertheless, he
remembered Wally&rsquo;s promise of the previous
day, and after all the other campers had come
out of the water after swim, he touched Wally
on the arm and reminded him that he was to be
taught the Australian crawl.</p>
<p>The life-saving crew now had its brief moment
of fun. They were having a game of water-tag
about the boats and up the diving-tower. Blackie
thought it great sport to be with them, and under
Wally&rsquo;s direction to seem one of the outfit that
was so much at home in deep water. He kept
one eye on their antics and with the other watched
Wally Rawn demonstrate the approved method
of breathing with the crawl stroke that sent him
plowing through the sunlit water at a speedy
rate. Then it came Blackie&rsquo;s turn to show what
he had learned, while Wally stood on the dock
and shouted directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&mdash;take a breath every fourth
stroke, and let it out under water! Don&rsquo;t use
that frog kick&mdash;use the trudgeon! Keep your
fingers together! That&rsquo;s the way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>At first Blackie found it hard to get the
correct timing for his breaths, but after some
twenty minutes Wally called a halt and put an
end to the lesson for the day, pronouncing himself
well satisfied with the boy&rsquo;s progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we keep on like this, you ought to win a
couple first places in the Shawnee meet, Blackie.
I&rsquo;ll give you some diving instruction later on&mdash;I
think I&rsquo;ll give all the fellows in the tent a chance
to learn a few jack-knives and swan dives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do we get if we win?&rdquo; asked Blackie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Award ribbons, and lots of glory for Lenape.
What more do you want? You&rsquo;re pretty young
yet, kid&mdash;but I hope it won&rsquo;t be long before you
find out that the biggest rewards in life are the
ones you don&rsquo;t get paid for. Money or silver
cups or ice-cream don&rsquo;t begin to compare with the
ownership of an alert mind, a strong, clean,
healthy body, fine friendships, and a reputation
for honor and manliness and courage. Do you
know there&rsquo;s a treasure buried here on the Lenape
campus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie was aglow on the instant. &ldquo;Where?
Do you know where to dig for it? Is it a pirate
treasure? Let me help you hunt for it, Wally!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>The man smiled. &ldquo;There you go again&mdash;always
on the lookout for a selfish, personal
gain! The treasure I mean isn&rsquo;t made of Spanish
doubloons and stolen jewels; but it&rsquo;s here, waiting
for every boy to find it for himself. If you&rsquo;ve
got the right stuff in you, Blackie, and I think
you have, you can take that treasure home with
you when you leave camp. It&rsquo;s a treasure you
wouldn&rsquo;t want to trade for anything else in the
world&mdash;the treasure of a true Lenape spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie&rsquo;s visions of delving in the dead of night
for a glittering hoard in a pirate chest vanished.
Somewhat downcast, he muttered, &ldquo;Aw, don&rsquo;t
preach! Just the same, I sure would like to take
home a bunch of money that I found up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, stranger things have happened. Guess
your mother would be proud if you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! It would help a lot; we don&rsquo;t have
much money since Dad left us. You see, she
runs a little store and sells sewing things and
fancy embroidery and stuff like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wally nodded. &ldquo;Did you ever stop to think
how much she is sacrificing to give you a good
time camping up here in the woods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; said Blackie uncomfortably.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go. We don&rsquo;t want to be late to-day&mdash;we
don&rsquo;t want to get the booby prize for inspection
twice in a row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">THE HERMIT&rsquo;S HOUSE</span></h2>
<p>That night after supper, when the whistle
had shrilled for silence, Happy Face
Frayne, who was officer of the day, made announcement
of the evening&rsquo;s program. &ldquo;We still
have lots of daylight left after supper, so we have
planned a few short hikes before dark. Then,
after that, we&rsquo;ll gather here in the lodge around
the fire and have some songs and stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurray!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Munson will take a group up the mountain
road to the Devil&rsquo;s Potato Patch. Mr.
Colby will head a boating expedition to the dam
at the end of the lake, while those who want to
visit Rattlesnake Joe, the hermit, will report to
Dr. Cannon. Those who stay in camp can have
a rousing game of volley ball&mdash;Long Jim Avery
and Lieutenant Eames will choose sides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurray!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dismissed!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where you going, you crazy Irishman?&rdquo;
Blackie asked his bosom friend Gallegher when
they were outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to start out with the bunch
up the mountain, and then lose myself. You
want to come?&rdquo; He winked significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see, if you come with me. We&rsquo;ll get
away from these babies and have a good time of
our own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Hi, Gil!&rdquo; shouted Blackie, as his
patrol-leader passed by. &ldquo;Where you heading?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up the lake. Say, you remember when we
hiked the short way to camp the first night we
came up? You remember that house you asked
me about? Well, now&rsquo;s your chance to see it
closer. That&rsquo;s where the hermit lives, and he&rsquo;s
a queer old bird if there ever was one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Gil&rsquo;s words the picture of that secret, sinister
house on the mountainside, as Blackie had
first glimpsed it, came back to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&mdash;thanks for reminding me. I&rsquo;m
sorry, Irish&mdash;I&rsquo;ll sneak off with you some other
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slipped away and joined the group around
Dr. Cannon, the camp medico, at the lodge steps.
There were some fifteen or twenty campers who
clamored about the short, sturdy figure of the
doctor, deluging him with questions about their
destination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;The old hermit, Rattlesnake Joe, is one of
the sights of this part of the country,&rdquo; he said,
quieting them with a gesture. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to
tell you anything more&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see him for yourselves
soon enough. Keep together&mdash;forward,
march!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys straggled behind him as he led the
way around behind the kitchen and the ice-house
and on past the Red Cross tent to the road.
Blackie marched in company with the Utway
twins and a shock-haired &ldquo;two-striper&rdquo; nicknamed
&ldquo;Sunfish&rdquo; because he had once fallen out
of a canoe and when he was pulled up on the
dock, it was discovered that he had unwittingly
trapped a good-sized sunfish in one of the pockets
of his sweater.</p>
<p>The hikers turned off to the right where the
road turned up the mountain, and headed down
a marshy lane bounded with a stone fence on
each side. The small, stinging deer-flies swarmed
about their heads, and Jerry Utway, one of the
twins, showed Blackie how to fasten a handkerchief
around his head so that it would flutter and
keep the bothersome insects at a distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that tree?&rdquo; asked the Sunfish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Blackie nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a black birch tree&mdash;the kind they
make birch beer from. Some time I&rsquo;ll show you
how to tap it and get a drink of the sap&mdash;it
tastes great. Here, take this twig and chew on
it. Doesn&rsquo;t it taste something like sassafras?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on&mdash;we&rsquo;ll be back with Elephant
Crampton in a minute,&rdquo; urged Jake, the other of
the twins. &ldquo;Hurry up if you kids want to see
the old hermit before dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They increased their pace, and caught up with
the vanguard about Dr. Cannon just as the mysterious
house came into sight at the end of the
lane. Surrounded by the shouting company of
the campers, Blackie was not so awed by the
place as he had been when, alone with Gil, he
had glimpsed it from afar on his first memorable
evening in camp. There were the same weathered
shingles on the low roof, the same dirty windows
and decaying out-houses&mdash;but it did not seem so
unreal and awful now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>On their approach they were announced by the
furious baying and howling of half a dozen
hounds that leaped and pulled at their chains
beside a rickety kennel by the door. The campers
drew back, hoping with all their hearts that none
of the dogs would break loose. The door was
flung open, and a tall old man stamped out and
began quieting the hounds, beating their heads
with a stick until they subsided, whimpering.
Then he turned and gazed strangely at the group
of boys, shading his eyes against the slanting rays
of sunset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, now,&rdquo; he said after a minute, &ldquo;if it
ain&rsquo;t the Doctor and the camp-ground boys.
How be ye, Doc?&rdquo; He extended a dirty and
claw-like hand. Blackie was near enough to
notice that the finger-nails were all about half an
inch long, broken, ragged, and encrusted with
mold.</p>
<p>Indeed, as Blackie watched him shake hands
with Dr. Cannon and step back to lounge in the
doorway, he seemed a far from attractive personality.
He was probably sixty years old, with
a tall, stoop-shouldered body. He leaned
slouchily against the rough doorpost, and the
blackened fingers of one hand nervously combed
a ragged and greasy beard that was streaked with
gray. The same tangled gray prevailed in the
straggling hair that crawled from beneath his
battered felt hat, and in the discouraged mustache
that drooped to mingle with the beard.
The hermit&rsquo;s eyes were bleared by sitting beside
a smoky fire, and were overhung by bushy brows.
Now and then, as he talked, he would profanely
quiet the hounds at his feet, who, it must be admitted,
were far more intelligent and far cleaner
than their master.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Glad ye&rsquo;ve come, boys,&rdquo; he drawled. &ldquo;Allus
glad to see boys here. Glad to see anybody. I
been livin&rsquo; all alone here five year now come
fall, sence my boy Jase left me to go over and
cut ties in Pike County. Good boy, Jase was,
but him and me couldn&rsquo;t get along right well
together. Say, Doc, when ye get back to camp-ground
ye kin give Ellick and the Chief my
regards fer sendin&rsquo; up that sack of flour last
week. Shore did enj&rsquo;y it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought you might,&rdquo; said the doctor.
&ldquo;These boys wanted to take a little hike to-night,
and I brought them up to call on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s fine&mdash;allus glad to see boys. Well,
boys, guess ye want to see my old thunderbolt,
don&rsquo;t ye? I allus show all the boys that thunderbolt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
He entered his house and with a
long knife pried up a flat flagstone, one of those
forming the hearth before his fireplace. Blackie
saw him kneeling in a shaft of sunlight beside the
cold embers, and watched until he drew forth
from its hiding-place what seemed to be a long,
thin, slate-colored piece of stone or iron. The
hermit brought it out and passed it around for
all to see. It was pitted and twisted, like a short
iron bar that had been exposed to rough use and
rust for years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s my thunderbolt,&rdquo; the hermit explained.
&ldquo;Ten year ago come August we had
a whackin&rsquo; big storm&mdash;black clouds piled high
over the hills here till it looked like midnight.
All of a sudden, bang! comes a big blast of
lightnin&rsquo;, and hit thet old oak tree out thar&mdash;it
was a big tree then, but it&rsquo;s only a stump now.
After the storm was all over I come out thar
and saw this stuck right in the middle of the
tree&mdash;had to cut it out with my old ax. Look at
it close, young fellers&mdash;ye don&rsquo;t get a chance to
see a reg&rsquo;lar thunderbolt every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys hurriedly passed the famous object
from hand to hand, for it was suddenly growing
dark and the doctor had announced that it was
time to leave. Blackie was not at all regretful
to leave the neighborhood of that ruined house,
which became more unfriendly as the long
shadows of the pines barred and striped its mouldering
walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long has he lived here?&rdquo; he asked Dr.
Cannon as they hiked on the return journey at
a rapid pace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;All his life, I guess,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;He
makes a poor living, cutting railroad ties and
raising a few pigs and chickens&mdash;just enough to
scrape along on. It just shows you what a life
of ignorance and dirt can do to a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that a true story about his thunderbolt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t really any bolts thrown down
during a thunderstorm. That thing he had may
be what is called a belemnite, or maybe just a
piece of meteoric iron he found, and made up
the story about it afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the return trip Jerry Utway discovered a
patch of gooseberries. He and his brother and
Blackie and Sunfish clustered about and found a
few berries that had ripened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Blackie,&rdquo; said Sunfish, talking with
his mouth full, &ldquo;guess you won&rsquo;t feel so lively
to-morrow night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? What&rsquo;s going to happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuck-Ups.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two-striper put his thumbs in his ears and
waggled his fingers mysteriously. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo;
he said meaningly. &ldquo;They initiate all the new
campers then. Big secret society; everybody
tries to join, but they don&rsquo;t always stand the tortures.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do they have real good tortures at this
camp?&rdquo; asked Jake. &ldquo;We joined up at Camp
Coutrell last year, so we don&rsquo;t have to get initiated
here. Oh, boy! We were black and blue for
a week afterwards!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they do to a guy?&rdquo; asked Blackie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find out. The Grand Mogul makes
the neophytes&mdash;the new guys&mdash;do all sorts of
things and go through all kinds of tortures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; announced Blackie, with a
sudden sinking of the heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll have to, if you want to be one
of the society. After you get in, it&rsquo;s lots of
fun helping to initiate the ones that join after
you do. And some day, maybe you can work up
to be one of the officers, like the Exalted Overseers
of the Rabble or the Supreme Potent Inquisitors
or the Sublunary Administers of the
Last Rites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds fine, but I don&rsquo;t want to be
black and blue for a week. Can&rsquo;t you get in
without being tortured?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said Sunfish. &ldquo;A guy has to go
through perils and trials before he ever amounts
to anything in the world. Come on&mdash;we&rsquo;ll be
the last ones in camp as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four hastened after that. A few hundred
yards from camp they came upon Fat Crampton,
weary but still determined, and cheered him
with the news that the tents were not far away.
Through the trees was borne the rollicking
chorus of the singers gathered about the fireplace
in the lodge, united in good fellowship and roaring
out the lilting words of the Lenape marching
song:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve travelled the world from shore to shore</p>
<p class="t">And sailed on every sea,</p>
<p class="t0">But there ain&rsquo;t no spot in the whole darned lot</p>
<p class="t">Like old Camp Le-na-pe!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">INITIATION</span></h2>
<p>The coming initiation ceremony of the
Stuck-Up Society was the chief subject of
conversation during Tuesday. Many were the
direful hints and bloodthirsty tales that the new
campers heard from the lips of seasoned Lenape
boys, who, of course, were all members of the
society and who were all occupied in getting out
their regalia and ceremonial weapons in preparation
for the big night.</p>
<p>Immediately after the supper dishes were
washed, the lodge was cleared of all except the
dozen members of the society who had been
chosen to arrange the mess-hall as the Throne
Room. Blackie, sitting on the steps in front of
his tent, could hear a prodigious thumping and
running and hurly-burly inside the lodge, but
could see nothing, because blankets had been
hung over all the windows and the door was
guarded. He was gravely watching Slater, who
had been initiated the year before. The red-headed
boy was putting the finishing touches on
a war-club he had just made, meanwhile whistling
the Funeral March in a dolorous key.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he asked, whirling the formidable
club by its thong. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re a member,
you can bear one of these at initiations too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, how do you make one of those clubs?&rdquo;
asked Blackie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First you find a nice little white birch tree.
You dig it up and cut it off about two feet above
the roots; then you peel it around the base and
sharpen the roots. Then you can cut your mark
and decorations and designs on the bark, like this.
If you soak it in water soon after it&rsquo;s cut, it gives
it this nice, red, bloody color.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All loyal Stuck-Ups come to the Throne
Room!&rdquo; came a call through the megaphone on
the lodge porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long,&rdquo; said Slater. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go up
now. I&rsquo;ll see you later. Take my advice and
don&rsquo;t get fresh with the Grand Mogul, or it&rsquo;ll be
all the worse for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>He departed, swinging his club with gusto.
Blackie left to join the group of new campers
who were gathered under the big black-cherry
tree by the baseball field to await the summons to
their doom. There were about forty of them;
among them he found many he knew, mostly
boys who had never spent a season at Lenape.
Lefkowitz, Guppy, Fat Crampton, and Gallegher
were those from Tent Four who, beside
himself, were to prepare to undergo the awful
ordeal. They sat about nervously on the stone
fence, trying to reassure themselves by bold talk
and a great deal of forced laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come!&rdquo; shouted one boy after a
while, and instantly there was silence. All eyes
were turned to watch the approach of the Outer
Guard, which consisted of four older boys marching
toward them in formation. Each one of them
wore nothing but a towel caught about his hips
and knotted on the side, and fantastic peaked
hats some three feet high that had been made by
wetting an ordinary felt hat and pulling it over
the end of a baseball bat until the crown had
stretched to a high point. The faces and bodies
of the Guard were barbarically daubed and
streaked with colored grease-paint, and each bore
over his shoulder a broad-bladed canoe paddle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>They solemnly halted beside the secretly trembling
neophytes, and &ldquo;Kipper&rdquo; Dabney, who
was in charge, spoke in hollow tones: &ldquo;Line up
by the alphabet&mdash;those with names beginning
with A are in front. You are all about to undergo
the dread inquisition of the Omnipotent
Stuck-Up Society. Meditate upon your benighted
souls, and ponder how best you can
serve the spirit of Lenape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He counted off the first four boys in the line,
and marched them away to the lodge porch.
Blackie saw Dabney give a secret knock and a
password; the portals of the Throne Room unclosed;
there was a flourish of trumpets, and
then an ominous silence that lasted until the
Outer Guard again came to take four more
aspirants to the great hall of the society.</p>
<p>Four by four, Blackie Thorne saw his fellows
vanish into the echoing Throne Room. He was
almost at the end of the line, and did not know
whether to be pleased or sorry that he would be
one of the last to be initiated; but Fat Crampton
went with the second bunch, and both Guppy
and Gallegher with the fourth. Blackie was surprised
to see the latter, about twenty minutes
after he had entered, ejected somewhat roughly
through the door and escorted down the steps by
two stalwart guards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;What did
they do to you, Irish?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, they booted me out of their old society!&rdquo;
mumbled Gallegher. &ldquo;They let that little
squirt Guppy stay in, though. Guess I didn&rsquo;t
bow down and lick their boots enough to suit
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Key down, you!&rdquo; ordered one of the guards.
&ldquo;You have been told to go to your tent. You,
Thorne, get back in line and wait your turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie returned to his place, wondering at this
new development. Gallegher had failed to pass
the trials for some reason; evidently the Stuck-Ups
did not accept everybody. But he figured
that he was at least as clever as Nightshirt Guppy
and could stand any test they might put to him.</p>
<p>At last there were only three neophytes left
under the cherry-tree&mdash;Blackie, a younger boy
named &ldquo;Peanut&rdquo; Westover, and Slim Yerkes.
Peanut had grown more and more timid as the
minutes passed, and at last ventured to address
the others in quavering tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do&mdash;do you think they&rsquo;re going to hurt us
much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Blackie. &ldquo;Who cares if they
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sneaked my pillow out here with me,&rdquo; confessed
the boy, &ldquo;and stuffed it in the seat of my
trousers. Some of the kids said they paddle you
something awful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re in for it now,&rdquo; said Yerkes,
pointing. &ldquo;Here come the guards for us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>The three neophytes were surrounded by the
serious-faced paddle-bearers and marched up the
steps to the porch. Blackie assumed a careless
expression to conceal his inward misgivings, and
whistled with as much bravado as he could muster.</p>
<p>Knock! Knock! Knock! Kipper Dabney
whispered a password through the keyhole, the
door swung open, and they were marched inside.
Two boys with sashes about their waists, whom
Blackie recognized as Ted Fellowes and his
younger brother, put pennant-hung bugles to
their lips and blew a clarion call that set the
rafters ringing. The huge room was dark except
for a space in front of the empty fireplace, where
a row of lanterns shed a yellow glare which,
however, did not reveal the faces of three men
who sat, robed in blankets, upon a high dais made
of benches piled one upon the other. About the
circle the grotesquely-costumed members of the
society sat in grim silence, nursing their war-clubs
and looking with threatening anticipation
at the three newcomers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>From the darkness came the gruesome chords
of the Funeral March, played on the concealed
piano; and down an aisle in the center of the
seated initiates proceeded the guarded trio.
Peanut Westover was shivering with fear, and
his knees were knocking together at every step.
With a roll of drums they arrived before the
dais, and were lined up facing the almost indistinguishable
robed figures of the Grand Master
and his two potentates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three more rash neophytes who would dare
the wrath of the honorable Stuck-Up Society,&rdquo;
announced Kipper in a sepulchral voice, and
with a deep salaam he stepped back and left the
three candidates together in the middle of the
lighted space. Blackie could feel everyone&rsquo;s eyes
upon him, and he had a tingling, shaky feeling
somewhere inside; but he resolved that not one
of them should think for a minute that he was
afraid.</p>
<p>The Grand Mogul upon his throne said nothing,
but surveyed the three boys before him with
tantalizing deliberateness. Finally he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have signified your desire to enroll your
unworthy names upon the laurel-crowned roster
of the honorable Stuck-Up Society. In order to
win to the gates of Glory you must first slay the
Dragon of Selfishness, defeat the Giant of Fear
and arm yourselves with the Helmet of Knowledge,
the Spear of Courage, and the Sword of
Justice. Are you ready to make the trial?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>He looked at Peanut at the end of the line,
and the boy quavered, &ldquo;Y-Y-Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sir!</i>&rdquo; roared the entire group within the
lodge, bellowing with all their might and beating
their clubs upon the resounding floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-Y-Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Peanut, more frightened
than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; asked the inquisitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P-P-Peanut, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a most suspicious bulge in your
trousers. Please remove the padding, Master
Seneschal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A boy stepped forth and removed the pillow
that Peanut had placed where he thought it
would do the most good, while the circle of
campers roared with laughter at his predicament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see how smart you are, Peanut,&rdquo; commanded
the Grand Mogul. &ldquo;Spell your name
with a sneeze and a hiccough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peanut looked bewildered. Blackie nudged
him and whispered, loud enough for everybody
to hear, &ldquo;Go ahead, kid&mdash;he won&rsquo;t hurt you.
He&rsquo;s only Sax McNulty dressed up a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd gasped, horrified at such unheard-of
impudence from a candidate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;One bell!&rdquo; said the Mogul solemnly, looking
gravely at the offender. Off at one side, a
dishpan struck with a drumstick resounded once
with a hollow clang. &ldquo;Now&mdash;go on, Peanut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking courage, the smaller boy began:
&ldquo;P&mdash;achoo!&mdash;E&mdash;hup!&mdash;A&mdash;choo!&mdash;N&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do. Now get down on the floor and
scramble like an egg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peanut gave the best imitation of an egg in
the process of being scrambled that he could
muster. When he had finished, Sax ordered him
to rise, and spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neophyte Peanut, you must learn that the
spirit of Lenape is found in sacrifice and self-denial.
Through secret channels I am informed
that your greatest weakness is wasting the time
of your leaders with foolish questions. To
remind you that it is better for a camper to discover
things for himself, I command you not to
ask a single question of anybody all day to-morrow;
if any member of the society hears you
ask a question, he will be entitled to hot-hand you
once. Now, you tall, gangling, skinny drink of
water on the other end,&rdquo; he continued, turning
toward Slim Yerkes, &ldquo;what have you got to say
for yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, sir,&rdquo; said Slim quietly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the trouble with you. You&rsquo;re
always so quiet that nobody ever knows you&rsquo;re
around. I&rsquo;ll bet a dollar to a flash of lightning
that you&rsquo;ve got lots of talent but are afraid to
let anybody know it. Camp is the place where a
boy learns to step out of the background and
show what he can do. You&rsquo;re here to-night to
help amuse the Stuck-Ups. Let&rsquo;s see&mdash;can you
sing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you go&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re a mighty fine
singer if only you had a little confidence. Now
clear your throat, sound off, and sing in a bold
voice &lsquo;How Dry I Am,&rsquo; starting from the end
and working forwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I dry how&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Slim croaked feebly.
The campers set up a groan, but the Grand
Mogul pretended to be immensely pleased at the
thin lad&rsquo;s singing ability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not so terrible. Now, just to make
you get out of your shell, I order you to put on a
free show to-morrow for anybody that asks you.
Just pretend you&rsquo;re a whole circus side-show, and
when they ask you, give imitations of the Fat
Lady, the India-Rubber Man, JoJo the Dog-Faced
Boy, the Snake Charmer, or anything
else they happen to think up. Now, next case
for the executioner!&rdquo; He transferred his attention
to Blackie Thorne.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Blackie insolently, deliberately
leaving off the title of respect. &ldquo;What
are you going to do to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sir!</i>&rdquo; roared the assembled Stuck-Ups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two bells! Three bells and the foolhardy
neophyte hangs on the red cedar at midnight!&rdquo;
intoned Sax McNulty. The dishpan gong resounded
with two slow strokes. &ldquo;You have
twice dared the wrath of the Stuck-Up Society.
What excuse have you to offer, you in the middle?
What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie resolved that he would not be daunted
by the rigmarole of the initiation as his two
companions had been, and answered as impudently
as he could, &ldquo;Aw, I go by the name of
Saxophone McNulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The listeners broke into a pandemonium of
hooting and roaring, almost drowning out the
booming of the gong sounding three bells. For
the first time the Grand Mogul&rsquo;s tone became
deadly serious, and when he could make himself
heard he addressed Blackie with measured calm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Though the Stuck-Up Society has assembled
here to-night in a spirit of fun, the unwritten
code of good-fellowship should govern our every
action as much now as at any other time. You,
Thorne, have deliberately disregarded that code.
Besides being an obvious falsehood, your answer
showed a silly wilfulness. In the few days you
have been at Lenape you have shown yourself to
be a &lsquo;fresh guy&rsquo; and a bully to those who are
weaker than yourself; you have shown a lack of
self-control and a selfish forgetfulness of the
other fellow. You get lots of fun out of playing
jokes on somebody else, but as soon as they play
a trick on you, you get sore and go off by yourself
and sulk. Am I right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so, sir.&rdquo; Blackie hung his head; he
hated to be talked to this way in front of all the
other campers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, Blackie,&rdquo; went on the leader,
&ldquo;that the difficult things in the world are the
ones worth fighting for. It&rsquo;s easy to be fresh,
to be a bully, to lose your temper, to stir up mischief;
but the worth-while things are gentlemanliness
and self-control. Everybody here will help
you all they can, but only you yourself can fight
the fight to make yourself a good Lenape camper.
When you have won that fight and proved that
you possess the spirit of sportsmanship and team-play,
you can have another chance to join the
honorable ranks of the Stuck-Up Society. The
initiation ceremonies will now proceed without
you. Go to your tent!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">THE SNIPE HUNT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Last night about dusk, when I was walking
by the marsh down where the creek
empties into the lake, I was surprised to discover
a large flock of snipe. Now, hunting this wary
game-bird is one of the sports that Camp Lenape
is famous for; and since in my opinion we
couldn&rsquo;t have better weather for it, I suggested
to the Chief that we have a hunt this very night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Carrigan, leader of Tent Nine and camp
naturalist, was making a report after supper the
next day; and judging from the cheer that went
up at his words, the sport he spoke of was one of
the greatest attractions that camp life could offer.
Blackie Thorne, sobered by his humiliating
experience in the Throne Room of the Stuck-Up
Society the previous night, listened with both ears
as the councilor continued his announcement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do not need to explain to campers who have
spent a season at Lenape that it is exceedingly
difficult to capture the elusive snipe. It requires
great care and skill to catch them, and since it
would be impossible for all of us to go after them,
it has become the custom for the old campers,
who have all bagged their birds, to give first
chance to the new boys and to act as &lsquo;beaters&rsquo;
and scare up the game for them. They will take
care of the inexperienced hunters, see that they
are placed in a good position along a well-known
snipe &lsquo;run,&rsquo; and do all they can to drive the birds
their way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, since many of the new boys will not
know about the habits and method of catching
this most famous of all game-birds, it will be
best to explain a few details. There are several
varieties of snipe. The variety that is usually
found on the Lenape campus is the &lsquo;coo&rsquo; snipe,
which may always be recognized by the fact that
its eggs are not round but cube-shaped. Another
variety, the &lsquo;fan-tail&rsquo; snipe, is found a few miles
north of here, near Camp Shawnee, our rivals on
Iron Lake. The snipe is a bird with long legs
and long bill, and the meat is very succulent,
tasting like a cross between turkey and lemon pie.
Ellick, our genial chef, is well-known for his
ability to fry snipe in the most toothsome way,
and has furthermore, out of his love for the sport,
offered a prize of one watermelon from the camp
ice-box to the first camper who brings in his
snipe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Cheers followed, for Ellick, for Mr. Carrigan,
and for the watermelon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best method of catching this cunning
bird,&rdquo; continued the leader when the noise had
died down again, &ldquo;is by means of the bag and
lantern. Each hunter should provide himself
with a burlap bag&mdash;or a pillow-case will do&mdash;and
a lantern of some sort. When one of the beaters
posts him along a snipe &lsquo;run,&rsquo; as we call the trails
which the birds make along the ground through
the bushes on their way down to the lake for a
drink, the hunter should prop the mouth of the
bag open with sticks, place a small pyramid of
rocks in front of it, and station himself behind
the bag with his lantern. He then at intervals
gives the snipe mating-call, like this&mdash;<i>coo-coo-coo!</i>&mdash;in
a soft and liquid voice. The snipe,
aroused and startled by the approach of the beaters
through the bushes, flies into the air in alarm.
Hearing the mating-call and mistaking the pile of
rocks for its nest, it flies toward the open bag,
and dazzled by the light in its eyes, blunders right
into the bag. Then all the hunter has to do is
to grab the top of the bag quickly, and the bird
is imprisoned alive and brought back to camp.
Remember&mdash;the first one to catch his bird wins
the watermelon!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>He sat down amidst a tornado of cheering.
During the uproar Wally managed to make himself
heard at the Tent Four table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With four hunters in our bunch,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;we ought to have enough snipe to-morrow to
make a full meal for the whole table. Soon as
we&rsquo;re dismissed, you fellows hop around and see
if Ellick hasn&rsquo;t got some old bags you can borrow.
Don&rsquo;t let anybody else get ahead of you
if you can help it&mdash;it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea to
have some watermelon to eat along with that
fried snipe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the whistle sounded, Blackie joined
the torrent of boys that poured out into the
kitchen to besiege Ellick for bags, boxes&mdash;anything
in which a bird might be trapped. The chef
looked about genially, finding something for most
of them, smiling and assuring them that the prize
offer was true, showing them the big green watermelon
that would fall to the lucky Nimrod.
Blackie was fortunate enough to find an empty
potato-sack, and after providing himself with the
powerful flash-lantern he had brought to camp,
was ready to put himself in the hands of the experienced
beaters, who would show him the correct
place to post himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>To his surprise, Sax McNulty, the councilor
who had served the previous night as Grand
Mogul and who had ordered Blackie&rsquo;s ejection
from the Throne Room, singled him out. The
gloomy-faced comedian nodded somberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Thorne! Going to redeem yourself
and make the camp forget last night by being the
first to get your snipe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; said Blackie, &ldquo;but
I sure am going to try. Say, Sax!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry I was so fresh last night. I
won&rsquo;t forget what you said about being a good
sport. And I didn&rsquo;t mean to act the way I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right. You didn&rsquo;t hurt my
feelings any. Just to show you we&rsquo;re good
friends, I&rsquo;m going to take you to the best place
on the campus for snipe. I know where there&rsquo;s
a &lsquo;run&rsquo; where as many snipe have been caught
as in all the other places within six miles. I&rsquo;ll
be your beater. Got your outfit? Good. Trot
along!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>He led the way at a rapid pace and Blackie
followed, lugging his bag and lantern. They cut
straight through the woods away from the lake;
in places it was already so dark that the boy
switched on his light to see the way. McNulty
made so many turns and twists that it was not
long before Blackie lost all sense of direction.
At last, much to the boy&rsquo;s satisfaction, the leader
announced that they had reached the place. He
helped Blackie rig up the sack with the mouth
propped and held open by sticks, and arranged a
pile of stones in front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my experience,&rdquo; said McNulty, &ldquo;I think
Mr. Carrigan is wrong about the mating-call. It
really sounds more like <i>kuk-kuk-kuk</i> than <i>coo-coo</i>.&rdquo;
He made the boy practise the call over and
over until he was satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you just wait here until I
beat a few down your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He departed stealthily through the undergrowth,
and Blackie crouched waiting behind his
glaring lamp. For ten or fifteen minutes he heard
nothing but the sweet whistles of the whippoorwill
and the timid twilight noises of the woods.
Then from the front came a series of halloos and
the crackling of a body passing through the
brush. McNulty&rsquo;s voice was raised in the
beater&rsquo;s call, advancing swiftly toward him. The
boy clucked as he had been told. There was a
whirr like that of wings, and a flashing shadow
in the bright beam of the light. Blackie fell forward
on his bag, sure that some wild thing was
struggling among its folds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get any?&rdquo; asked McNulty, rushing up with
a long stick in his hand. &ldquo;Here&mdash;let me take a
look&mdash;careful now! Don&rsquo;t let him out, whatever
you do! Easy&mdash;I&rsquo;ll hold it, and you reach down
and pull him out. Don&rsquo;t be scared&mdash;they just
peck you a little bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gingerly, and not at all sure that he would
like to be pecked by a sharp bill even a little bit,
Blackie put his arm in the bag and felt about.
His fingers closed on something, and hastily he
jerked it forth. Instead of a struggling mass of
feathers, his hand held only a bunch of tangled
grass and twigs.</p>
<p>Sax McNulty snorted in disgust. &ldquo;Thought
you had a snipe! Huh! Here I drove a whole
covey of them right at you! Didn&rsquo;t you see
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I thought I saw one fly right into the
bag! How did this get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to know. Well, guess I&rsquo;ll have
to go through it all again&mdash;and it&rsquo;s no fun beating
these bushes. I&rsquo;m all scratched up already. If
you don&rsquo;t have better luck this time, we&rsquo;ll have to
go somewhere else. I&rsquo;ll have to go almost to the
top of the mountain as it is&mdash;I&rsquo;ve already covered
the ground near here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>He moved away and disappeared into the July
night. Blackie settled himself for a long wait.</p>
<p>It was lonely there in the woods. He thought
over one by one every incident that had happened
since he had landed in camp. Already four days
of his slender two weeks at Lenape had passed;
only ten days more and he would have to return
to the hot city, far from the exciting adventures
of forest and lake and lodge.</p>
<p>It seemed to him that hours had passed since
Sax had left him. He listened with all his might
to try and pick up the leader&rsquo;s shouting off in the
silent woods. Mosquitoes, attracted by the light,
swarmed about him and made him miserable with
their tormenting hum; he slapped at them, but
still they came to sting his neck and wrists and
ankles. He would have turned off the light, but
knew that if he did so he would miss his chance
of bringing in any snipe; and he was determined
not to return to camp without at least one bird.
By this time many of the new boys should have
captured their prey; and he could not think of
returning empty-handed. Why didn&rsquo;t McNulty
return?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Gradually it dawned upon him that the leader
would not return, that he had not intended to return.
It must all be a joke! Just another of
those innumerable hoaxes which camp custom
had decreed should be played upon all tenderfoot
campers during the first days of their first season
under canvas. It must be just a conspiracy
among the experienced campers and leaders to
decoy the credulous greenhorns out into the
woods alone under the pretext of a hunt for
snipe. With a bag and lantern! The whole story
seemed so impossible to him that he wondered
how he could have been taken in by it. Sitting
behind a pile of stones and a gaping potato-sack,
cooing and waiting for birds to fly his way! McNulty
must have bundled up grass and twigs into
a ball and thrown it into the bag when he had
approached on the pretense of &ldquo;beating&rdquo; the
birds toward the light. And how he and the rest
of the knowing ones would laugh at Blackie when
he returned to camp, shamefaced and abashed
at having been hoodwinked by such a ridiculous
flimflam! Snipe that laid cube-shaped eggs!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>The thing must be faced like a good sport,
however. If he hurried back to camp, he might
still arrive in time to watch some of the other
victims come in, and thus have the laugh on
them&mdash;&mdash;He suddenly realized that he was not
sure which was the way back to camp. He had depended
on the guidance of McNulty, and did not
have the least idea where he was, or how far away
the tents might be. Well, he would have to explore
a bit, pioneer the way home for himself.</p>
<p>Carrying his flash-lamp hooked on his belt, he
beat his way through the scrub carefully, on the
lookout for snakes and other dangerous dwellers
in the forest. He blundered across a narrow ravine,
pushed his way through a clump of laurels,
and climbed a stone fence. The light showed on
the rutted tracks of a lane that wandered through
the trees&mdash;a lane that seemed somehow familiar.
Sure enough! It was the road that led to the
gloomy house of Rattlesnake Joe, the hermit;
it was the trail he and the others had followed
only two nights before!</p>
<p>He knew his way now. The stars were out,
and a half-moon was tilted among the tree-tops.
He snapped off his lamp, so that it would not
draw too many mosquitoes, and found he could
follow the lane well enough by moonlight. Taking
the direction that led away from the hermit&rsquo;s
dwelling and toward the campus, he trudged
along by himself, almost laughing to think how
easily the snipe-trick had worked. It was a good
joke; and next year, if he came to camp, he could
have the fun of taking some scary tenderfoot out
into the woods and planting him there for the
evening, to coo and wait for snipe that would not
come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Only about five minutes passed before he was
aware that someone was coming toward him up
the road; he could hear the low mumble of voices
only a few hundred yards in front. Could one
of them be McNulty, alarmed because Blackie
had not yet turned up in camp, and coming to
seek him and break the news? If so, he was due
for a little scare; the jester would himself be the
butt of a jest. Blackie planted himself behind
a thick oak trunk, ready to jump out with a shout
and throw the bag over the leader&rsquo;s head and give
him the fright of his life.</p>
<p>The voices came nearer; one of them harsh and
bullying, the other sounding strangely weak and
pleading. Blackie pondered. Neither of them
could be McNulty. They must be strangers,
even men who, finding him alone, might do him
harm. He resolved to keep quiet and let them
pass without noticing him. Inwardly congratulating
himself for turning off his light, he concealed
himself as best he could behind the friendly
oak. The voices grew louder; they were rough,
uncouth, and profane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Two slouching figures emerged from the dark,
and stopped right beside the tree Blackie had
chosen. He could have reached out his arm and
touched them both. There was a scratching
sound as a match was drawn across a rock; a red
flicker burst forth and revealed two faces bent
to light cigarettes. The face of the taller man
was seamed and dirty, and the unshaven jowls
were covered with gray stubble. A green patch
hung over one eye, giving him a peculiar and
sinister look. The other man was younger, with
a slack mouth and watery eyes, and a vacant face
that showed he had little or no will of his own.
Both were garbed in loose, patched garments
streaked with mud and torn in places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tramps!&rdquo; thought Blackie. &ldquo;Gee, they sure
look hard-boiled! If they ever find me
here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He crouched behind his shelter, fearing
that they had seen him already.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, what ya want to be yeller for?&rdquo; the
older man was growling. &ldquo;I tell ya it&rsquo;s a sure
thing! He lives all alone up there&mdash;I heard all
about him down in Elmville. The hermit, they
call him around here, and everybody knows he&rsquo;s
got a silver mine somewheres in the mountains
that he won&rsquo;t tell about! Every once in a while
he sneaks off and digs up some silver and buries
it under the stones of his fireplace!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are ya sure, Reno?&rdquo; asked the other, in snivelling
tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course I&rsquo;m sure! I seen him myself the
other night, diggin&rsquo; up the stones at the fireplace
and takin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; out that looked like a bar
of silver. There ya stand moanin&rsquo; like a sick
chicken, and all we have to do to get rich is just
walk in and tie him up and take the silver!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might be seen!&rdquo; The younger man&rsquo;s
terror was increasing every minute. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s
got dogs, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blast the dogs! They&rsquo;re all chained up anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how about them kids?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, they&rsquo;re all in bed by now. If you&rsquo;d seen
that bar of silver like I saw, you&rsquo;d pull yer
freight and get the job done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie wanted to cry out and tell them that
the hermit was poor, that he had no money or
treasure at all, that the man must have seen him
looking at his precious thunderbolt which he kept
under the hearthstone. But his mouth was so
dry with terror that he could not make a sound.
He leaned against the tree for support, and the
lantern on his belt clinked against the rough
bark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; The weak-chinned man
jumped nervously about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, yer jumpy as a cat to-night! &rsquo;Fraid of
the dark, ain&rsquo;t ya, Lew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard somebody in the bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not likely. If I thought there was, I&rsquo;d pull
out his windpipe. There ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to be scared
of. Now, will ya come, or will I have to do the
job meself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll come, Reno.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men moved off in the direction of the
hermit&rsquo;s house. Some minutes passed before
Blackie dared to relax his body from the stiffened
position his fright had put him into. Reason
told him to get away from the spot before he was
discovered and would have to face the wrath of
the two tramps alone; but curiosity and an uncanny
fascination seemed to draw him to the
house whose grim face had somehow haunted him
since first he had arrived at Lenape. With lagging
steps, he followed down the lane toward the
fateful, tumbledown dwelling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>As he drew near the door, his terror increased.
The hounds were making a dismal racket in their
kennel, rattling their chains fiercely. One small,
dusty window on the ground floor showed red
with firelight; the rest of the house was dark.
Drawn and yet repelled by what might be going
on behind the weather-beaten walls, he dared the
chance of one of the dogs escaping and attacking
him, crept to the door, and listened.</p>
<p>The sound of voices raised in anger came to
him, a bedlam hubbub of words. He thought he
could distinguish the peculiar, slouchy dialect of
Rattlesnake Joe above the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re crazed, ye devils! I&rsquo;ll have the law
onto ye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will ya tell us where yer silver mine is located?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! I won&rsquo;t tell ye a tarnal thing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was the clatter of a chair overturned on
the board floor. A piercing, terrifying scream,
hoarse and horrid, came once and broke off. A
heavy body slipped noisily to the floor. Afterward
endured a hushed, strained silence, during
which Blackie heard with distinctness the beating
of his own pulse and the hollow ticking of a clock
beyond the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>The wind was rising; a gust swept over the
roof of the somber house, rattling the loose
shingles and stirring the tops of the pines. Its
coming brought panic to Blackie Thorne. He
turned and, with eyes starting with horror, fled
away into the dark with the ghastly memory of
that hoarse, despairing scream still ringing in his
ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">A RAINY DAY</span></h2>
<p>Blackie did not mention to a single soul
what he had seen and heard at the hermit&rsquo;s
house the night of the snipe hunt. He wanted
nothing more than to forget the terror which had
gripped him by the throat as he stood outside
the door of the house in the woods. Indeed, when
the crystal clear morning came and the busy
camp routine began, it was hard to believe that he
had witnessed any dark deed the night before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>As the days passed, he almost forgot he had
ever overheard the two tramps planning robbery
and violence upon a harmless old man. The glorious
Fourth of July came and went, leaving only
burnt fingers and a powder-blackened litter of
colored papers on the baseball field as souvenirs
of the sparkling and explosive celebration.
Wally continued his lessons in the Australian
crawl, and also taught the Tent Four group
many things about the art of diving. Camp Lenape
held a field meet, and Blackie was awarded
three ribbons of various colors as trophies of his
prowess in running and jumping. Tent Four
wiped out its bad record by winning inspection
three times in succession. On Friday night each
tent group put on an impromptu show or stunt,
ranging from a vaudeville act with a trick horse
(front part, Gil Shelton; hind legs, Spaghetti
Megaro) to an uproarious imitation of a tent
full of sleepy-heads turning out for Reveille.
Blackie and Gallegher spent much of their time
studying to pass their requirements for the honor
emblem, and at the Indian council on Monday
night they both were summoned before the
Chief&rsquo;s seat and proudly received the coveted
badge.</p>
<p>Blackie was awake twenty minutes before First
Call on Tuesday morning, and passed the time
stitching the swastika emblem on the front of his
jersey. The sky was dull and leaden; for the
first time since he had come to camp there was a
smell of rain in the air. When the campers were
returning up the hill after the Indian dip the
storm broke, bucketing down in torrents; the boys
went up to breakfast in raincoats and ponchos,
and stood assembled for flag-raising on the long
porch of the lodge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was going out with the pioneers to help
build a signal-tower this morning,&rdquo; Blackie
grumbled over his oatmeal at breakfast, &ldquo;and
here it&rsquo;s got to go and rain. Gee, what rotten
luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why worry?&rdquo; asked Ken Haviland; &ldquo;Rain
doesn&rsquo;t spoil anything here at Lenape. Last year
we had so much fun on rainy days that I&rsquo;ve been
wishing for a wet day soon. We&rsquo;ll have a good
time to-day, and don&rsquo;t forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, lots of things. Everybody stays here in
the lodge, and we have boxing and wrestling
matches, indoor track meets, or signalling contests.
Maybe some of the leaders will tell stories.
Rainy days are good times to practise for the
big show that comes at the end of every section,
or to get the dope on map-making, life-saving
drill, forestry and merit badges. Some fellows
can work in the carpenter shop on handicraft. I
remember one wet day last year we had a big
mud-marathon around the lodge. Everybody
put on old clothes and went through a big obstacle
race; we almost laughed ourselves sick.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Haviland&rsquo;s prophecy was correct; the program
for the day was more active and strenuous than
for a day of sunshine. The campers put the
lodge in order, cleared away a big space in the
center, and brought in a tall heap of firewood
for the cheerful blaze that was crackling in the
stone fireplace. Wally Rawn, who as officer of
the day was supervising the program, caught
Blackie by the arm as he was helping to lay down
some large, padded wrestling mats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackie, will you go in to the Chief&rsquo;s office
and get the O. D. report blank for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet, Wally!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie skipped over to a far corner of the
lodge, where the Chief had a small room fitted
with a desk and cabinet to hold the camp letters
and records. The door was slightly ajar, and two
voices sounded beyond. The Chief had a visitor.
Blackie paused at the door, hesitating to intrude
upon the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just stopped on my way from Elmville,&rdquo;
came the heavy voice of the visitor. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t
find out anything about the matter there, and as
I was riding back over the mountains I thought
I might as well stop on the chance that you might
know something about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Lane, who brings in our provisions, told
me what he&rsquo;d heard in town,&rdquo; answered the Chief.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I know. Wednesday night it happened,
wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the coroner thinks. The body
wasn&rsquo;t found till Friday&mdash;nobody goes up there,
you know, and the old man lived alone. It was
just by luck that one of the neighbors stopped
in to see him, and found the body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t help you, Sheriff. It&rsquo;s a
terrible thing to have such a murder so near
camp. And the old hermit wouldn&rsquo;t have hurt a
fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sheriff! Murder! Blackie clutched the doorpost
and almost fell over at the words. The
hermit!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the sheriff, scraping back his
chair as he rose, &ldquo;if you do hear anything, I live
over by Newmiln Center. You can send word
to me there. It&rsquo;s a puzzle, sure enough. As
brutal a thing as I ever heard of in all my experience;
if it was robbers that did it, they surely
didn&rsquo;t find anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you catch them,&rdquo; said the Chief fervently.
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t give you any
clue. Good day!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Blackie just had time to collect his thoughts
and run away from the door before he might be
discovered listening. He dashed off and joined
the group about the wrestling-mats, covertly
watching the man who came out of the office.
The sheriff was a heavy-set, black-mustached man
in spurred and muddied riding-boots and glistening
slicker. He stamped across to the back door
and, while Blackie watched at a window, mounted
a waiting horse and cantered off down the muddy
road through the downpour.</p>
<p>The watching boy heaved a sigh of relief; he
had escaped being caught and questioned. The
two tramps must have tried to force the hermit
to tell what he knew. The old man, of course,
possessed neither a treasure nor the secret of a
silver mine, and in the struggle he had somehow
been&mdash;killed. Murder! What an ugly-sounding
word it was! Blackie shivered. He wanted to
forget; but he knew that never in this world
would he lose the memory of that sullen, threatening
house and the racking scream that had issued
from it on that fatal Wednesday night.</p>
<p>He looked about him. The rainy-morning program
in the lodge was already in full swing. In
front of the fireplace Lieutenant Eames had
roped off a square space and was giving boxing
instruction to an interested group. Two older
boys, their fists hidden in bulging padded
gloves, were clumsily sparring together under a
rapid stream of cautions and advice from the lieutenant
and a perfect hail of cheers and urgings
from the howling bunch of spectators.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;Put your body behind it!&rdquo; counseled the
West Pointer. &ldquo;Place your blows where they&rsquo;ll
do the most good&mdash;don&rsquo;t thrash around wildly.
There&mdash;not bad! Don&rsquo;t run away, Pete; stand
up to him and defend yourself with the gloves.
Whoa!&rdquo; The two boys, smarting under a few
well-placed blows, were mixing it in earnest, their
fists whirling rapidly but with little damaging
effect. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough&mdash;you can&rsquo;t fight best
when you lose your tempers. Now, who&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Match me with somebody!&rdquo; urged Chink
Towner. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my turn now, Lieutenant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom do you want to take on, Chink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The onlookers chorused a suggestion.
&ldquo;Blackie! Blackie Thorne! Here he is now!
Take him on, Chink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about it, Blackie?&rdquo; asked the lieutenant.
&ldquo;Want to try a round or two with
Chink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie&rsquo;s scare was still too close to him to
want to think about anything else, but he resolved
not to display the white feather before the group.
He could not refuse. &ldquo;Aw, sure, I&rsquo;m not afraid
of him. Give me the gloves!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Jerry Utway volunteered to serve as his second,
and jumped to help him. Jake Utway, not
to be outdone by his twin brother, took Chink&rsquo;s
corner and laced on his gloves. The news of the
bout spread around the lodge from group to
group, until quite a number of campers crowded
about the ring. Ellick, the chef, drifted in from
the kitchen, and agreed to judge the contest.
Tent Three rallied to support Chink, their champion,
and the Tent Four boys patted Blackie on
the back and whispered words of advice or encouragement.</p>
<p>Wally Rawn came over while Blackie was
stripping to shorts and tennis shoes. &ldquo;You
shouldn&rsquo;t be matched with Towner,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a longer reach than you have, and
knows more about boxing than you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t back out now. I&rsquo;m not scared of
him anyway,&rdquo; Blackie muttered, but his heart was
racing and he had a chilly feeling in the pit of his
stomach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, remember to keep your guard up all
the time, and don&rsquo;t lose your head. Another
thing&mdash;don&rsquo;t set your body stiff until you&rsquo;re
ready to hit; if you&rsquo;re relaxed a blow doesn&rsquo;t hurt
so much. But don&rsquo;t let him take you off balance,
or you&rsquo;ll find yourself chewing the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Bewildered by the shouting and the hasty advice,
Blackie found himself in the center of the
ring. The lieutenant was introducing the contenders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this corner, Battling Towner, the Chinese
challenger; to my right, Kid Blackie, the Bloodthirsty
Bantam. Shake hands, gentlemen! First
round&mdash;time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys closed in upon each other warily,
exchanged a few watchful feints and passes.
Chink led with his left; Blackie sprang out of the
way, and swung harmlessly at the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get into him, Thorne!&rdquo; squealed Jerry
Utway. &ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t a pillow-fight! Hit him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chink feinted with his left and aimed a blow
with his right that caught Blackie on the arm,
whirling him half around. He caught his balance,
leaped forward, and closed in a clinch so
tight that neither boy got in any blows before
they were separated. They parted; there followed
a few seconds of brisk sparring; then Chink, with
lightning footwork, dodged under Blackie&rsquo;s
guard and planted a thudding glove upon his
face. Blackie was knocked backwards; he shut
his eyes and crouched with his gloves over his
face and his arms tight to his chest. The spectators
shouted, cheering for Chink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First blood for the Chinese lightweight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yay, Tent Three!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get into him, Blackie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie set his teeth. The blow had stunned
him for a minute, but it had the effect of making
him forget the crowd, forget everything but the
crouched figure of the boy before him&mdash;his antagonist.
The faces of the watchers and the referee
seemed to show through an unreal haze. He
struck out at Towner, and landed on his body;
but Chink retaliated with another crushing blow
upon the nose. A numb feeling settled upon
Blackie&rsquo;s senses; his limbs seemed to be yards
long, the gloves to weigh tons. What was he
doing out here in front of the crowd, jumping
around breathlessly and being struck again and
again? Even Chink&rsquo;s face came to him half hidden
by a dreamy mist. He fought and fought,
yet Chink never seemed to be touched; he darted
about, apparently placing his fists where he
pleased.</p>
<p>A gong sounded; hands reached out and pulled
Blackie to his chair. He felt a splash of cold
water on his face; Jerry Utway was rubbing his
arms with a towel. &ldquo;Round one&mdash;won by Mistah
Chink!&rdquo; came Ellick&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Again Blackie was aware that the gong had
sounded, and once more he was facing Towner.
The other boy was breathing heavily, but was apparently
as light on his feet and as ready with his
hands as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After him, Blackie&mdash;the best defense is an attack!&rdquo;
It was Wally&rsquo;s voice, coming coolly to
him from beyond the ring. Blackie caught his
breath and plunged with whirling arms after the
shadowy form of his opponent. Chink closed in
for an exchange of body blows and another clinch,
in which Blackie got the worst end of it. Towner
was depending mostly upon blows to the face,
concentrating all his attack upon the nose and
mouth, placing shrewd hits on these places one
after another. Blackie had the feeling that he
was fighting against a ghostly figure, an antagonist
as elusive and intangible as smoke. He
began hitting out blindly, thoughtlessly, raging
and hating Towner with all his might. A red
flag seemed to drop before his eyes, and he
charged with his fists hammering like pistons,
careless of the rain of blows that fell upon his unprotected
head. He was seeing red, running
wild, losing all his skill and direction in a mad,
senseless rush. Through the clamor of the crowd
came Wally&rsquo;s low counsel again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your head, Blackie! Self-control!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>The mist began to clear. He felt a jolting,
sharp blow on the chin, was aware that Chink was
off to one side and that in his blind charge he
was nowhere near his antagonist. He fell back,
protecting his face; then, suddenly, he whirled
and struck out with his right arm extended. His
glove seemed to plunge forward of its own accord
and land with a smack on Chink&rsquo;s face. The
other boy fell back with an amazed look in his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time! End of de bout&mdash;no decision!&rdquo; cried
Ellick.</p>
<p>There were shouts of protest; the campers
wanted a fight to a finish. Ellick only shook his
head and nodded in the direction of Blackie&rsquo;s corner.
Blackie saw his comrades staring at him
strangely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He tapped you one on the nose, all right,&rdquo;
said Jerry, giving him a cup of water.</p>
<p>Blackie looked with surprise at his hand, still
encased in a leather glove. The casing was
stained with a few darkening crimson drops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of it? I can still lick him! I&rsquo;m just
getting started!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Eames crossed over to them with
one arm on Chink&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, you&rsquo;re not whipped by a long sight,
Thorne,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But we can match up you
two again some other time. Now, you two boys
have been swatting each other all around the ring
enough to satisfy anybody. Another thing,
Blackie&mdash;I can see that you don&rsquo;t know the first
thing about scientific self-defense, but you have
two things that are most essential to a good
boxer. You have good muscular control, and
you keep your wits about you all the time. If
you want to spend some time with me, I think
after a few lessons I can make a pretty fair boxer
out of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, will you, Lieutenant? I&rsquo;d sure like
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He relinquished his gloves to another boy, and
a third match began, while Wild Willie Sanders
and Soapy Mullins began a wrestling bout. The
group split up and drifted away, while Blackie
slipped into his clothes. His nose had stopped
bleeding, and he was feeling a glow of happiness
that came from the words of the boxing instructor.
He felt a hand on his shoulder, looked
up and saw Wally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you took a beating to-day, all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chink didn&rsquo;t lick me,&rdquo; frowned Blackie.
&ldquo;They stopped us because he tapped me on the
nose.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;He hammered you all over the ring; I said
you were no match for him. Chink Towner did
give you a beating; but I was watching another
fight at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, you talk funny sometimes, Wally.
What fight do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were fighting against your own self,
Blackie, when you were there in the ring. And
you won that fight. I saw you. For a minute
you got mad, lost your control; then you got hold
of yourself and began to use your head. It was
a good thing for you to go against a fighter better
than yourself; you learned to take your medicine
and keep your temper. And they&rsquo;re both good
things for a young lad to know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">THE LIE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You put up a pretty good scrap,&rdquo; grunted
Gallegher approvingly.</p>
<p>Blackie had donned his shirt and sweater after
the boxing bout. &ldquo;Thanks, Irish,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen lots of tough fights, and I know
what I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo;, see? Say, are you tired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not very.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say we take a little walk? I&rsquo;m
sick of bein&rsquo; shut in this lodge all mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie looked out a window; the rain had
slackened, but still drizzled down with settled
persistence. &ldquo;In the rain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;what&rsquo;s a few drops matter? Put on
your raincoat and come along.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>The two boys slipped into their rainproof ponchos,
and then Gallegher led the way a short distance
through the wet woods behind camp. Here
he turned off and struck through the brush toward
the mountain, following a line of lead pipe
that ran from a spring above down to the lodge,
supplying fresh, cold water for the use of the
camp. A trail had been cut when the men had
laid the pipe, but it was overgrown and indistinct,
and it was easy to see that few campers ever
passed that way. After about a quarter of a mile
of trudging in silence through the dripping forest,
Gallegher turned off and floundered through
the undergrowth until he came to the thick trunk
of a fallen tree that lay rotting on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not so bad, eh?
I come here lots of times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked Blackie curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo; Gallegher stuck out his chin,
and winked meaningly. &ldquo;Have a good time,
away from all the baby kids in camp. See what
I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fished out a crumpled, gaudily-colored
package from his shirt, and held it out to Blackie.
Within were a few cheap cigarettes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; exclaimed Blackie, &ldquo;cigarettes!
Where did you get them, Irish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, I always carry some. I like to get away
and have a little smoke by myself now and then.
Have one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been smoking all the time we&rsquo;ve been
up here? Say, don&rsquo;t you know the Chief sends a
guy home right away if he&rsquo;s caught smoking?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;What of it? He has to catch us first, and
nobody ever comes here. Don&rsquo;t chew the rag so
much; light up and be happy.&rdquo; Gallegher
winked again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naw&mdash;I&rsquo;m in training for boxing practice
with the Lieutenant,&rdquo; said Blackie uncomfortably.
&ldquo;Smoking is bad for the wind, and I got
to have good lungs to be a good scrapper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, one won&rsquo;t hurt you,&rdquo; Gallegher jeered.
&ldquo;Know what I think? I think you&rsquo;re scared
you&rsquo;ll get caught. You&rsquo;re just yellow, like all
the rest of the babies at this camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not scared. Here, give me one, Irish.
I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie seized one of the white cylinders and
hastily lighted the end. Gallegher lit another
and settled back on the fallen tree trunk, puffing
away expertly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty soft, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; agreed Blackie, fumbling amateurishly
with the lighted cigarette. He coughed and
wiped away the tears that formed in his eyes as
the smoke blew into them. &ldquo;Say, are you sure
nobody ever comes around here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure they don&rsquo;t&mdash;especially on a rainy day.
I&rsquo;ve had a quiet little cig here lots of times.
Don&rsquo;t get scared, kid&mdash;we&rsquo;ll be safe. Besides,
now we both got the honor emblem, we can get
away with lots of stuff. If you wear one of these
things on your chest&rdquo;&mdash;he indicated the green
swastika and the &ldquo;L&rdquo; upon his sweater&mdash;&ldquo;you
can put over stuff that would be too raw for other
guys to get away with. I&rsquo;ve been kind of layin&rsquo;
low lately, but believe me, there&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be
some fun around this camp pretty soon, and I&rsquo;m
goin&rsquo; to get back at the guys that kicked me out
of the Stuck-Up initiation. Are you with me,
Blackie? They did the same dirty trick to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;sure I&rsquo;m with you, Irish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have another fag, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, one is enough for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, have another. What are you afraid
of? We can eat a hunk of candy before we go
back to camp, and nobody will ever know a thing
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie accepted another, but threw the stump
away before he had smoked much of it. He
didn&rsquo;t like it, but the idea of sitting there hidden
in the woods doing a forbidden act that would be
heavily punished if it were known gave him a
devil-may-care, excited feeling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Later, after they had sneaked back to camp
for swim, he did not feel quite so dashing. The
secret act now appeared sordid. He felt uncomfortable
and guilty; he could not forget what he
had done, and went to bed that night with an
uneasy fear that he might be discovered any minute.
He dropped off to sleep assuring himself
that never again would he let Gallegher or anybody
else persuade him to break a camp rule and
do an unworthy, hole-in-the-corner deed.</p>
<p>He awoke some time later. A pocket flashlight
was shining in his face, and he blinked fearfully
for half a minute before he came to his senses.
Dimly he heard Wally whisper close to his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up and put on your bathrobe, Thorne.
I want you to come up to the lodge with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find out later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could hear the heavy breathing of his tent-mates
about him as he struggled into his bathrobe;
but when he stepped outside the tent he was
surprised to find that all of them were not asleep.
Gallegher, also attired in his bathrobe, stood
waiting outside on the path with Wally, who had
not yet undressed for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it, Wally?&rdquo; asked Blackie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About ten-thirty. Now, keep quiet and don&rsquo;t
wake up the rest of the fellows. Come along.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>The two boys followed him up to the lodge.
The rain had stopped, and a crisp, bracing wind
was blowing up from the lake. As they mounted
the steps leading to the lodge porch, they saw a
light still burning in the little office in one corner
of the building. The Chief had not gone to bed
yet, either. Wally opened the outer door, and
stepped inside to let them enter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way, you two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys exchanged scared glances. There
was no time to do more. They stepped inside.
The Chief turned in his chair and bent a serious
look upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Gallegher, Thorne. Come on in,
Mr. Rawn. Now, I have had your leader bring
you boys up here because I wanted to ask you
some questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gallegher slumped in his seat with a scowl.
Blackie shivered; he did not dare to face the
Chief, but looked away, fearing what was to
come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rawn tells me,&rdquo; continued the Chief in
an even tone, &ldquo;that to-night at Taps, he noticed
that something fell out of Gallegher&rsquo;s pocket as
he was undressing. He brought this object to
me. Here it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie stole a glance at the man&rsquo;s outstretched
hand. It was as he feared. The Chief was holding
a crumpled paper package of cigarettes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;I asked him to bring Gallegher to me right
away. He was seen going into the woods this
morning, and as Thorne was with him, I asked
that both of you be brought up to talk with me.
The directors of Camp Lenape, knowing that
smoking is injurious to the health of growing
boys, have a rule that any boy who smokes while
at camp will be sent home in disgrace at once.
Have you both heard that rule?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to ask each of you a question, and
you are on your honor to answer it truthfully.
Gallegher, have you smoked cigarettes while at
Camp Lenape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence. Gallegher bit
his lip and considered. He was caught with the
goods. He shrugged and mumbled, &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie felt the Chief&rsquo;s eyes upon him.
&ldquo;Thorne, have you been smoking at camp,
too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He must not be sent home! Blackie shifted in
his chair and tried to think. Sent home in disgrace,
away from all the wonderful times at
camp; sent back to town, to face his mother&rsquo;s disappointed
eyes, to be in the city and know that
he had missed the big camp show, the boat regatta,
the swimming meet&mdash;&mdash; The Chief and
Wally couldn&rsquo;t be sure&mdash;Gallegher wouldn&rsquo;t give
him away&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;Answer me, Blackie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was only one way out. &ldquo;N-No, Chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had done it! He had lied; deliberately he
had told an untruth to save his own skin. He
was glad the Chief was not looking at him any
more, but had turned his attention to Gallegher.
Blackie stared at the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gallegher, I&rsquo;m glad you haven&rsquo;t made it any
worse by lying about your act,&rdquo; the director was
saying. &ldquo;Now, because you&rsquo;ve owned up to it
like a man, and because I know that you have
lived in a bad neighborhood back in town and
might in that way have picked up some wrong
ideas about things, I&rsquo;m going to give you a choice
that may permit you to stay on here at camp.
You can either leave camp to-morrow, or stay
here and chop wood for the kitchen three hours a
day. You&rsquo;ll lose your honor emblem, of course.
Which is it&mdash;stay or leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gallegher turned away, so that the Chief could
not see his face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay and chop wood,&rdquo; he
muttered with a catch in his voice. &ldquo;And&mdash;thanks,
Chief.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you took that choice, Gallegher.
Camp has done a lot for you, and I&rsquo;d hate to lose
you now. Mr. Rawn, you may all go back to
your tent now. Good-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wally nodded briefly, and the three left the
lighted office. Not a word was spoken; they
walked slowly and thoughtfully back to Tent
Four, and turned in silently.</p>
<p>Between his blankets, Blackie drew a deep
breath for the first time since he had been
awakened. If Gallegher only did not give him
away, nobody would ever know, and things would
be just the same as before. Nevertheless, he did
not find it easy to get to sleep, and woke before
dawn to lie wretchedly in his bunk until the
activity of the day would begin and he might win
forgetfulness in the rush of the day&rsquo;s program.</p>
<p>The first blow fell just before breakfast, when
the entire camp strength was lined up after flag
salute and morning Call to the Colors. Hungrily
expectant and waiting for the command to march
in to mess, the arrayed campers were surprised
to find that the Chief delayed in giving the command.
He stood beside the flagpole with a stern
look in his eyes. The boys stirred in the ranks,
shifted their feet curiously, uncomprehendingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t he tell us to go to breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee&mdash;I never saw him do this before!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet in the ranks!&rdquo; came the command of
Mr. Avery, the officer of the day. &ldquo;Attention!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expectant bodies stiffened. The Chief
cleared his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Timothy Gallegher, five paces forward!&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>A ripple of astonishment ran down the line.
Blackie felt a movement at his side; Gallegher
had left his place and now appeared in front of
the Chief, standing with a strange white look on
his drawn face, swaying slightly in his place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Timothy Gallegher, you have been guilty of
conduct unbecoming to a Lenape camper. You
will here, in the sight of all your comrades, be
stripped of the honor emblem which you have
been found unworthy to wear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd gasped. Gallegher never moved,
staring in front of him with a blind tenseness.
The Chief reached into his pocket and drew forth
a clasp-knife, opened one of the sharp small
blades. From the end of the line came a muffled
tattoo; little Pete Lister, trap-drummer in the
camp orchestra, was sounding a rattling roll on
his drum, as he had been told to do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Slowly, in the sight of all, the swastika-L on
the front of Gallegher&rsquo;s sweater was cut away.
The thin blade slit the stitches, and the Chief&rsquo;s
hand tore away the green and white emblem of
honor. Blackie watched Gallegher&rsquo;s face, fascinated.
He should be out there, too, taking his
medicine, suffering along with the Irish boy; he
was just as guilty, and more so, for at least
Gallegher had not lied about his guilt. Blackie
wanted to cry out, to tell them all that he should
be standing there, too, with the Chief tearing
away his own badge; but he stood rooted in his
place with a dry tongue and pale cheeks beneath
his tan.</p>
<p>Now it was too late. The Chief had put the
emblem and the knife into his pocket; the drumming
had stopped; Gallegher shambled doggedly
back to his place in the line, beside Blackie and
the other boys of Tent Four. The chance to
confess was past. Blackie rather envied Gallegher;
he had owned up and taken his punishment,
and however hard the work on the woodpile
might be, at least he would have no ugly
stain on his conscience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right face! Forward&mdash;march!&rdquo; The files
trailed up toward the lodge steps, and instantly
a curious babel of voices broke out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, what did you do, Irish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you must have done something pretty
wild to get stripped like that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, shut up!&rdquo; said Gallegher. &ldquo;Key down,
see? That&rsquo;s my business. Maybe, if the guys
that run this camp knew their stuff, I wouldn&rsquo;t
be the only one to get stripped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Slater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean a thing, see? Not a thing.&rdquo;
He looked darkly at Blackie, who pretended he
had not heard. The boys of Tent Four clattered
up the steps. There was a smell of breakfast
in the air; everything was forgotten at the
thought of heaping dishes of cereal, hot biscuits,
steaming cocoa. But Blackie took his seat in
worried silence, bowing his head for grace. As
he looked down, there showed before him the
emblem sewed on his jersey, the swastika-L he
had won but had disgraced and now wore dishonorably.
He had a sudden, unreasoning desire
to pluck it from its place and throw it to the
floor. It wavered before his eyes, the burning
badge of his shame.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">KANGAROO COURT</span></h2>
<p>The day dragged on miserably for Blackie.</p>
<p>He had a feeling that the eyes of his tent-mates
were always furtively upon him; when he
would face them suddenly they would look away,
but he could feel their silent condemnation. Gallegher
spent the morning hours at work on the
woodpile; Blackie saw him now and then bent
over his job, toiling alone. They had not spoken
together since Wally had wakened them both the
night before; they did not speak at dinner or in
the tent during siesta hour afterwards. Blackie
felt that the Irish boy was avoiding the very sight
of him.</p>
<p>When Recall sounded after siesta and the boys
of Tent Four tumbled out for the afternoon&rsquo;s
fun, Blackie did not leave his bunk. He found
himself alone with little Nightgown Guppy, who
sat on the tent step busily scooping out a section
of birch wood for a bird-house. He worked along
in silence, but finally raised his head curiously
and put a question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Blackie? Are you feeling
sick or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not sick, you fool!&rdquo; growled Blackie,
turning over on his pillow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, why don&rsquo;t you get out and play
baseball with the bunch? The campers are playing
the councilors to-day, and you ought to be
in the game. I never thought you were a guy
that would spend all his time doing bunk-duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who cares what you think? Shut up and
beat it. I&rsquo;m sick of hearing you babies bawling
around all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guppy worked on for a minute. &ldquo;What are
you sore about, Blackie?&rdquo; he asked after some
time. &ldquo;Is it because you&rsquo;re scared the Chief will
know you were smoking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie sat up with a jerk. &ldquo;How do you
know I was smoking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, everybody knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Gallegher said anything, I&rsquo;ll knock his
block off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t have to say anything. We all
know you were in on it, and lied out of it to the
Chief.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>The bunk creaked as Blackie jumped up and
advanced toward the smaller boy with doubled
fists. &ldquo;You say I&rsquo;m a liar? By Jimmy, I&rsquo;ll fix
you for this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hit me!&rdquo; said Guppy, dropping his
tools and edging away. &ldquo;All I said was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said enough!&rdquo; Blackie scowled fiercely,
seized the lad&rsquo;s arm roughly, and gave it a
wrenching twist until Guppy cried out with pain.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll teach you to keep your mouth shut
around me! Now, will you be calling me a liar
any more? Will you? Will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; screamed Guppy. &ldquo;I only said&mdash;&mdash;You
let me be, Blackie Thorne, or you&rsquo;ll be
sorry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie gave the arm another vicious turn.
&ldquo;If I hear you ever say again that I was smoking
with Gallegher, I&rsquo;ll kill you, do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said a new voice. Blackie
looked up. Facing him were Ken Haviland, Gil
Shelton, and a group of older boys who had
approached unnoticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get him!&rdquo; called Gil in a low tone. He and
Sunfish jumped and caught Blackie&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to struggle, or it&rsquo;ll be worse for
you,&rdquo; continued Ken. &ldquo;All right, Gup&mdash;he
won&rsquo;t bother you any more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Blackie found himself pinioned on both sides,
and a husky guard of four veteran campers
formed about him. They put him, still struggling,
on a locker in the center of the tent. Ken
Haviland assumed a seat on top of an upper
bunk, where he could look down upon the prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Kangaroo Court will now convene,&rdquo; he
said solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo; protested Blackie. &ldquo;Gil,
I thought you and Sunfish and Soapy Mullins
were friends of mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence before the judge,&rdquo; warned Gil.
&ldquo;You are now in court. We&rsquo;ll let your arms
loose if you promise not to run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why? If one of the leaders comes along
now, you guys will sure look stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of the leaders are down at the baseball
field,&rdquo; Sunfish assured him. &ldquo;Anyway, it&rsquo;ll be
worse for you if any of them hear tell of this.
Now, shut up! The court-martial is beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ken Haviland, on his perch above, cleared his
throat and began to speak. &ldquo;Gentlemen of the
Kangaroo Court, you have been called together
to try the case of Blackie Thorne of Tent Four,
Camp Lenape. You will see that justice is
done.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>The boys seated themselves about on boxes and
bunks. There were eleven of them, all from different
tent-groups, and all boys who had spent
at least one season at Lenape. Ken looked
sternly at Blackie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prisoner, you are charged with breaking the
camp law against smoking and deliberately lying
about your act when questioned on your honor.
Are you guilty or not guilty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Gallegher&rsquo;s been squealing, huh?&rdquo; exclaimed
Blackie. &ldquo;Well, what of it? What
right have you to treat me like a convict?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The right of the Kangaroo Court. You&rsquo;re a
tenderfoot at camp, so I&rsquo;ll explain to you what
we&rsquo;re doing here. The Chief and the councilors
have nothing to do with it now. You were asked
on your honor if you had broken a camp rule,
and we know that you told a lie. Instead of
owning up and taking your punishment like a
man, you broke your word and sneaked out of
it. The Chief accepted your word; that&rsquo;s all he
could do. But the campers of Lenape have
something to say about how a fellow like you
shall be treated. This court represents every
boy in camp, and every boy will stand by our
decision. Are you guilty or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie sneered. &ldquo;And I suppose if I say I
am, you and this gang of yours will run and
tattle-tale to the Chief!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;I said that the Chief has nothing to do with
this. And you only hurt yourself by acting
ugly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Blackie sullenly. &ldquo;I did it.
What are you going to do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen of the court, the prisoner has
confessed his guilt. All in favor of inflicting the
usual penalty will rise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every one of the eleven boys rose to his feet.
Blackie looked from one face to another of those
who had been his friends, and read there only
reluctant determination. Ken Haviland tore a
scrap of paper from a notebook in his pocket, and
scribbled on it with a pencil. Soapy Mullins
yanked Blackie to a standing position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prisoner,&rdquo; said Ken gravely, &ldquo;the unanimous
decision of the Kangaroo Court is that you shall
be given the Black Spot.&rdquo; He held out the scrap
of paper, and Blackie took it wonderingly.
There was nothing on it save a rude pencilled
black disc in the center. &ldquo;From this moment
you are branded as a disgrace to Camp Lenape,
and not a single camper will speak so much as a
word to you. Court&rsquo;s adjourned!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>The members of the court departed toward the
baseball field, taking Guppy with them, and the
culprit was left alone with the marked piece of
paper still in his hand. He crumpled it with an
angry gesture, and tossed it to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! They must think they&rsquo;ve done something
smart! The Black Spot! Nobody will
talk to me&mdash;we&rsquo;ll see about that! And what if
they don&rsquo;t? A lot I&rsquo;d care if I never saw any of
this bunch of Sunday-school kids again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He caught up a hat and marched down to the
ball field, drawn there by a desire to brazen it
out and see if his sentence meant anything. The
boys&rsquo; team was at bat, and Lefty Reardon, captain,
was coaching off third base.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Lefty!&rdquo; Blackie hailed him. &ldquo;How
about giving me a game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lefty turned, looked him up and down quietly,
and turned away again as though he hadn&rsquo;t heard
the question. Blackie flushed, and after standing
uneasily for a minute, tried to look unconcerned
and strolled down to the gathering around
the batter. There was a low ripple of whispers
at his approach; boys nudged each other and
turned to look, turned away with half-hidden
smiles of contempt. He did not even dare to
speak to one of them. For the moment he was
tempted to rough-house one or two of the
younger boys just to see whether or not they
could be made to speak; but he remembered what
had happened when he had twisted Guppy&rsquo;s arm,
and knew that any defiance of the unwritten code
would be useless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the score?&rdquo; he asked of the world in
general.</p>
<p>Not a boy answered him. Someone at his
elbow snickered; no one looked in his face. He
felt like a ghost, a branded being who had no
right among that bunch of happy campers; he
was lonely in a crowd.</p>
<p>The only reason he watched the game to its
finish was because he refused to give the boys the
satisfaction of having driven him away. It was
the most wretched afternoon he had ever spent.
He sat, drawn apart from the rest, inwardly
seething with fury and wondering how long he
could stand it. He forgot the exhilarating,
breath-taking delights he had enjoyed at Lenape;
he could only remember the little dislikes he had
acquired, the humiliation of his ejection from the
Stuck-Up initiation, the crude and unceasing
jokes that had been played upon him. He hated
the Chief, the leaders; with all the boys against
him, staying at Lenape was unbearable. He
would leave the hateful place! It was the only
thing to do&mdash;run away from them all and never,
never come back!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>He sat there moodily, pondering the plan in
his mind. It was easy enough to decide to run
away&mdash;but where should he go? If he went back
to the city, he would have to face his mother with
a tale of disgrace, and the boys of the camp
would soon discover that their punishment had
driven him home like a whipped dog. If he
slipped away and went east, toward Elmville and
the railroad, Wally would soon discover that he
was missing; a hunt would start, he would be
easily traced and found before he could get far,
and he would be brought back to camp again,
baffled and more of an object of reproach than
ever. But if he could manage to get too far
away to be traced, and stay hidden somewhere for
three or four days, they would think him dead,
and when he finally did return they would be so
glad they would forget all about his crime, would
be sorry they had caused him to run off alone.
The open road, that was the thing! He would
be a hobo for a while, might even bum his way
to some city miles off, having an adventurous
time on the road while the Lenape kids did their
smart little tricks and acted like Sunday-school
babies and thought they were having a good time!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>After some thought he decided not to leave
immediately, but to wait until supper-time.
He was watched too closely now; every boy in
camp knew of his sentence and was covertly
watching to see how he would take it. But if he
slipped away when the camp was assembled in
the mess hall, it was not likely that he would be
seen. Wally might wonder what had become of
him, but would not take steps to find out until
after the meal; and by that time Blackie hoped
to be several miles away in a direction they would
not expect him to take. He had seen the county
map which hung in the lodge, and knew that
Newmiln Center, on Flatstone Creek, was about
ten miles as the crow flies northwest over the
mountains, in a rich farming region that was
separated from camp by miles of wilderness into
which nobody ever penetrated. They would not
look for him on top of the ridges; they would
never suspect that he dared go there. Why,
given a fair start and three hours of daylight, he
might even make Newmiln Center before dark
closed in!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; Blackie muttered darkly to himself.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show them I won&rsquo;t knuckle under, no
matter what they do!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>He would take his blankets, he decided, and
also his flash-lantern, ax, and compass. The next
problem was food. That would have to be taken&mdash;&ldquo;hooked&rdquo;&mdash;out
of the kitchen somehow. But
unless there was one of the kitchen crew at work,
the place was always kept locked. He would
have to manage, somehow.</p>
<p>He thought over his plans during the two
hours before Retreat and the evening flag-lowering
ceremony. He did not appear for swim, but
spent the time making a neat roll of his blankets,
which he hid along with his flash-lamp, compass
and ax in the bushes beside the road behind camp.
He knew that if his absence at the swimming
dock was noted, the boys would put it down to
wanting to escape their silent contempt.</p>
<p>He was in his place when Retreat Call
trumpeted out over the lake; but when the usual
evening rush to tables began and the files clattered
up the steps, he slipped around to the back
door of the kitchen. He found himself in the
pantry; shelves of canned goods lined the walls,
under which were bins of vegetables, and the
mirrored doors of the huge ice-box took up one
side of the room. During the hush that preceded
the saying of grace in the mess hall, he could
hear Ellick whispering directions to Leggy and
his other dusky assistants, who were busied dishing
up the meal. This is what Blackie had
counted upon, having the kitchen crew so busy
at this time that they would not see him. Hastily
he slipped a few potatoes and a can of peas into
his shirt, and ran to the ice-box. A cool, humid
breath of air came out to him as he opened the
door and peered inside; it was dark within, and
he felt about hoping to locate something he could
take. His hand touched a plate of cheese, and
he drew forth a good-sized chunk. There was a
rattle of dishes from the kitchen. Ellick&rsquo;s voice
came to his ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;Leggy, you just hurry up now and bring in
de butter from de ice-box!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leggy&rsquo;s dragging footsteps sounded across the
floor. With frenzied haste Blackie grabbed at
whatever happened to be under his hand. It
proved to be a slice of ham. Slamming the ice-box
door, he clattered across to the exit and ran
out of the skinny kitchen-helper&rsquo;s sight. That
had been a close squeak! Pausing only to stuff
the ham and cheese into the pockets of his
sweater, he darted around behind the wooden
building that was used for an ice-house and
gained the rutted road that led toward the mountains.
Here he found his blanket roll and accouterments,
slipped the roll over his head and
hooked the ax and lantern on his belt, and trotted
westward through the woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">THE HUT ON BLACK POND</span></h2>
<p>Half a mile up the road, where it turned at
right angles to climb the mountainside,
Blackie paused and took his first compass observation.
His course was northwest; but he remembered
that if he looked at the compass only
now and then, he might go wide of his goal; the
thing to do was to take an observation, note a
landmark ahead in line with the NW on the
compass, make straight for that place, and from
there make a new observation on another landmark.
The little shifting needle showed him
that his first leg of the journey should take him
diagonally up the wooded mountain to a grayish,
scarred slide of stones that showed ahead in the
dropping sun. He knew what that was, although
he had never been there. It was the terminal
moraine Gil Shelton had pointed out to him the
day he had first landed in camp&mdash;the Devil&rsquo;s
Potato Patch, the campers called it&mdash;a heap of
blotched, round boulders known as a favorite
resort for rattlesnakes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Blackie knew he must hurry if he was to reach
the Flatstone valley before dark. Pausing only
to stow his plundered supply of food more
snugly in his pockets and to shift his blanket-roll
to the other shoulder, he set off across an expanse
of marshy pasture land toward his first goal.
The deer-flies swarmed about his face and neck,
stinging pitilessly, and he increased his pace as
much as he could to get away from them. He
had been prudent enough to wear his heavy hiking
shoes, but in several places he floundered into
muddy pools and sank into dirty water over his
ankles. At last he reached the heavily-wooded
base of the mountain, and was forced to slow
down and begin a determined climb through the
underbrush, up ledges of yellow, mossy rock, and
across slippery patches of shale where he had to
go slowly and watch his footing. Half-way up
the mountainside, he gained the bottom of the
terminal moraine. Huge rocks, gray with lichens
and scratched in rough, random designs, stretched
above him; he was forced to leap precariously
from rock to rock, always upward, several times
catching himself just in time to avoid a nasty
headlong fall. Once, indeed, he slipped on a bit
of moss, and toppled sidewise into a cranny
between two of the boulders. His blanket-roll
saved his body from being more than bruised;
but in falling one hand slipped under his body,
and his heavy electric flash-lamp banged down
upon a rock, crushing one of his finger-tips badly.
The darting pain brought tears to his eyes, and
he shook the injured finger violently. Scrambling
to his feet for fear he might have fallen
close to the hiding-place of some vicious, venomous
timber-rattler, he struggled on over the
great rocks; and after what seemed like hours of
toilsome climbing, he at last gained the top of
the first ridge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>There, on the mountain&rsquo;s top, the evening
light was brighter, but in the valley he had just
left the shadows were long and cool. He turned
and faced toward the east. There was the lake,
spreading like a polished deep mirror that reflected
the gold and blue evening sky, the serried
rows of trees along the margin. There were the
ordered rows of white tents, the top of the lodge
roof with smoke wreathing lazily from the stone
chimney and with the bare flagpole standing up
beyond. He could see Camp Lenape as if it were
a toy model spread out at his feet, almost hidden
in the gray-green foliage of the forest. A slight
breeze brought to him the faint clatter of trays
from the mess hall, the confused hum of campers&rsquo;
voices. They would be almost finished supper,
now. Wally and Haviland and Gallegher and
the rest would be sitting about the mess-table,
wondering where he had disappeared. Well, let
them worry!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>The thought of supper made him remember
that he had had nothing to eat since dinner-time.
He pulled out the piece of cheese he had looted
from the ice-box, and began gnawing upon it.
He could eat a little while he rested. He turned
a bit to the left. Beyond the pasture-land he had
crossed on his flight, he saw a line of trees that
marked a lane. He knew that lane; it was the
one which led to the hermit&rsquo;s house, the road he
had followed the night he had heard murder done
by the two tramps, Reno and Lew. He could
barely make out the weather-stained, mottled
shingles of the roof of the house, and shivered
slightly. He would be glad to go anywhere, anywhere
away from the neighborhood of that grim
house of crime.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Pulling out his compass, he marked a new line
of march across the undulating summit of the
mountain. It pointed toward a blasted pine
taller than the rest, and he resolved to make for
that. The going was easier here on the mountain;
the daylight was clearer, and the trees
were stunted and far apart, scrub pine and small
oaks no more than waist-high, for the most part.
Blackie trotted along with assurance, chewing
upon a piece of raw ham torn from the slice in
his pocket in lieu of supper. He crossed a ravine
and stumbled up the other side; this took time,
and now he could almost watch the sun dropping
inch by inch toward the line of trees in the west.
There was not a sign that human beings had ever
passed that way; Blackie knew that no one ever
penetrated that desolate wilderness except deer-hunters
and blueberry pickers in the fall of the
year. When he again gained level ground, he
found that somehow he had lost sight of the
blasted pine he had picked as a landmark. This
did not trouble him much; he took out the compass
and again sighted toward the northwest.
His finger was bothering him more than anything
else; the tip had swelled, and the nail was
fast turning an angry purple color. It felt
double its size, and as the boy swung along it
throbbed and ached until Blackie was desperate
with pain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>He had covered about a mile and a half since
landing on the plateau on top of the ridge when
he came to a section that was marked by long
wooded swales, rank with rotting vegetation,
crossing his path. The sun was dropping lower
and lower; it shone like a flaming, bloody ball
close to the horizon, and its slanting rays blinded
his eyes until the woods about him seemed dim
and unreal. He determined not to deviate from
the line he had laid for himself, for fear of
getting off the track; and when he came to the
giant bole of a fallen tree, he tried to climb over
it instead of going yards around. The knobs and
splinters of the rotting trunk caught at his clothing
and his equipment; while scrambling over the
top he slipped and fell prostrate across it, knocking
the breath from his lungs. A train of white
ants crossed his arm, and when he crawled slowly
and clumsily to his feet, he felt their red-hot
stings on his wrist and up his sleeve. It seemed
that the insects were everywhere under his clothing,
jabbing their poisoned darts of pain into his
skin. He jumped from the top of the trunk,
landing on his face and scratching it until it was
crossed by bloody lines. The ground now became
marshy, and he was beset by a humming tribe of
mosquitoes. Still he staggered on, until brought
to a stop by a spread of green, scummy water
that barred his path completely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Blackie considered. At the rate the sun was
disappearing, and at the rate he was taking to
make a few miles across the mountains, he would
never reach Newmiln by dark. It would mean
a night alone in this unexplored region, a night
of fighting mosquitoes and unceasing watchfulness
for rattlesnakes, night-prowling animals,
and perhaps worse. He remembered all the tales
he had ever heard of lone travellers caught at
nightfall in strange and desolate solitudes, of
attacks by bears, wolves, ghosts of slain Indians.
And suddenly, like a chilling cloak, fear came
to him and enveloped him. He felt the short
hairs of his neck rise and prickle; an icy finger
trailed down his spine. He would have to get
on; he must cross the swamp somehow, anyhow!</p>
<p>The water in the slimy pool was only a few
inches deep; through the green scum he could see
the muddy, coated bottom. Feverishly he looked
about him, and seized a number of fallen branches
that lay on the ground, filled with the idea of
making a rough bridge by casting them across
the few feet of swamp ahead. He worked
furiously, and soon had a network of branches
thrown ahead, across which he hoped to run and
so gain the far side. There was no room behind
him for a clear take-off; it would have to be a
standing jump. He stood for a second, getting
up his nerve; and with a leap he landed upon the
center of the improvised bridge. There was a
snapping crackle of branches&mdash;the ones he had
chosen were ground branches, and rotten. They
gave under his feet, breaking and sinking into
the mud; and he fell headlong on his face into the
sticky ooze.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>The swamp was a sucking enemy, trying to
drag him under and hold him close, until the foul
waters should close over his head; it bubbled
under him, seeming to chuckle like a fiend.
Frantically he fought his way to an upright position;
he was standing almost waist-deep in the
slime. Urged on by fear, he floundered forward,
caught at an overhanging bush, and pulled himself
slowly to firm ground. There he lay for a
minute, gasping with exhaustion and terror after
his exertion. The lower half of his body was
soaked with filthy mud; his face and blanket-roll
were draggled and stained from his fall. But he
must not stop; he must push on, onward to the
northwest!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>For ten minutes he wandered through the
marshy swales, avoiding the frequent pools
whenever he could. The forest was too thick for
him to spot any landmark ahead, and he gave up
the idea of climbing a tree for an observation, because
it would take up too much of his precious
time. At last the ground sloped upward again;
open spaces began to appear; the footing was
easier. He pushed on, deadly afraid to halt in
that darkening place of horror.</p>
<p>Blackie never remembered afterwards very
much what he did during the remainder of that
twilight march. He had a picture of himself&mdash;a
hungry, weary, frightened figure, dwarfed by the
bigness and ominous vastness of that solitude,
caked with drying muck, scratched with twigs
and thorns, and ever followed by a cloud of stinging
mosquitoes&mdash;fighting his way through the
desolation. He had the feeling of one in a nightmare,
when the dreamer is pursued by darkness
and nameless horrors, and the very ground
seems to rise and clutch and hold him back. And
he remembered coming to the edge of the rhododendron
thickets and feeling that he could not
go on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>The tangled network of the rhododendrons
fronted an implacable barrier to his steps. There
was no way to go around. It offered little resistance
as he first plunged into it, but as steadily
as he advanced, as surely did the branching horns
of the shrub take hold on him. It was like trying
to walk through a gigantic wickerwork basket,
woven of tough and intertwined saplings. Again
and again he plunged like a line-bucking football
guard, and inch by inch fought his way. In one
place he tried to stoop and crawl beneath the
clutching branches, and was caught among the
roots as in a vise, until he felt that he could move
neither forward nor backward, but would have
to stay imprisoned in that dusky brake until he
died of thirst and starvation. He gave a frantic
heave, and was free to fight his way further.
The shadows were lengthening; the clock of the
sky warned him that his time was short.</p>
<p>In the midst of his trouble he began talking
desperately to himself; and finally he broke into
high-pitched, shouting song. Over and over
again he roared out to the brooding silence of the
woods every hymn-tune he had ever heard.
Ridiculously, he thought this would protect him
from the unnamed evils of the place, and the
singing certainly bolstered his courage.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Abide with me! Fast falls the eventide,</p>
<p class="t0">The darkness deepens&mdash;Lord, with me abide&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>He had lost his hat, he did not remember where.
Plunge&mdash;plunge&mdash;forward through the gripping
coppice!</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,</p>
<p class="t0">Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>At last! He gave a wild cry and broke through
the last entangling thicket, and the rhododendrons
crackled closed behind him. He was free
again!</p>
<p>He did not pause to take any more compass
courses, or to straighten his clothing or pack, or
to snatch a bite of food. He broke into a staggering
run. His flight took him for about half
a mile, into the bloodshot eye of the sun. He was
dripping with perspiration, and heaving great
shaking sobs. A fallen pine tripped him and he
rolled heavily down a steep bank. When he
picked himself up he found that he was standing
on a dimly-traced path through the woods&mdash;a
bare, almost invisible trail, but a path nevertheless,
leading in what he thought was the direction
he should follow.</p>
<p>A path meant that humans passed that way at
some time or another, and might lead to habitations
and possible discovery. But the forest
terrors so clouded the boy&rsquo;s mind that he welcomed
any companionship, no matter what kind.
It would at least give him company and allies
against the loneliness that beset him. It was
growing dark; a blue jay somewhere overhead was
bickering to himself among the pine branches.
Blackie trotted down the path.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>It led him along a wooded ledge of naked
rock, and down across a marshy flat place where
a brook widened and lost itself in a dense hedge
of rushes. He crossed on a series of flat stones,
and ascended a little hill. One look, and he gave
a shout of surprise.</p>
<p>There, spread before him beyond the margin
of the reeds, was a long flat sheet of water, a
mountain tarn whose unruffled surface, like a
plate of polished steel, gave off the last dying
beams of sunset. He had come too far to the
south; he was off the course he had laid for
Newmiln Center. This must be Black Pond, the
long body of water he had seen marked on the
map in the camp lodge.</p>
<p>The pond, hidden among the rocks and dark
trees of the mountain, at no time had a friendly
look; now, at nightfall, it presented to the weary
boy a face full of sinister threat. He was several
miles out of his way; further progress that
night was impossible. He would have to camp
here on Black Pond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>He was just turning away to locate a camping
place, when his eye was caught by something
which he had not noticed in his brief survey of
the pond and its surroundings. Through the
trees to the right a thin wisp of smoke was
curling up in a languid spiral.</p>
<p>Someone was camping beside the pond!
Blackie did not hesitate; the fear of spending the
night alone offered no choice. He ran to the
end of the path. There, beside the still waters
of Black Pond, was a small shack rudely knocked
together from rough pine slabs and chinked with
moss. The spreading wings and steel-edged
talons of a hawk, shot at some time or another,
were nailed to the wall near the low door, in the
usual back-country fashion. The smoke of a fire
came from a stone chimney at one end. A small
rowboat with a puddle in the bottom was drawn
up on the muddy shore.</p>
<p>Blackie paused for a moment. He didn&rsquo;t like
the looks of the place, but beggars can&rsquo;t be
choosers; it was now quite dark, and the smoke
indicated a cheery fire inside. Some hunter or
fisherman, who used this small hut for his camp,
must be inside. Blackie tiptoed to the door and
knocked hesitantly.</p>
<p>From beyond the rough barrier came a startled
grunt, the sound of a body moving swiftly across
the hut. Blackie knocked again, growing more
and more concerned as the silence continued.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>With a sudden jerk the door was flung open,
and a man&rsquo;s figure appeared outlined in the firelight,
with one arm menacingly upraised, wielding
what seemed to be a short iron bar. Blackie
Thorne stared, and gave a shrill scream of
fright.</p>
<p>He was looking in the face of the man called
Reno, one of the two tramps he had overheard
on the night of the snipe hunt planning to rob
old Rattlesnake Joe of his imaginary treasure!
He could plainly see the seamed face, the gray
unshaven jowls, and the green eye-patch of that
sinister character.</p>
<p>The tramp was as surprised as the boy. &ldquo;In
the devil&rsquo;s name, it&rsquo;s a kid!&rdquo; he bellowed. &ldquo;A
kid, Lew! Nab &rsquo;im, quick!&rdquo; He made a dive
for Blackie, but the boy, pulled by terror, had
already taken to his legs back up the path&mdash;away,
away from that evil face in the hut. He stumbled
frantically through the dark&mdash;the further
away from Black Pond, the better! Behind him
he could hear the baffled howling of Reno. He
would escape yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>He stumbled, felt a pair of gripping arms
about him, holding him tight so that he could not
struggle. A hoarse voice called, &ldquo;Here he is,
Reno! Got the bloody little rat!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; came the response. &ldquo;Bring &rsquo;im here
to the light. If he&rsquo;s a spy, I&rsquo;ll pull out his little
throat, blast &rsquo;im!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helpless and too weary to fight any more,
Blackie felt himself being picked up roughly and
carried toward the hut on Black Pond that was
the hiding-place of the two murderous vagabonds
who had done to death the harmless old hermit of
the Lenape hills.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">ROBBERY BY NIGHT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Bring &rsquo;im over here to the fire, Lew,&rdquo;
directed Reno, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll just have a look
at his ugly mug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger tramp carried Blackie to the
hearth and threw him down on his back, still
gripping him about the body with both hands.
Reno, the man with the patch over his eye, stood
up against the fireplace the bar he had been using
as a weapon. Blackie recognized that bar at
once. It was the object the hermit had shown
them when the campers visited him&mdash;his prized
&ldquo;thunderbolt&rdquo; that had been the direct cause of
his death. Dazed, he watched Reno stir up the
fire and draw forth a blazing brand which he held
up for a torch, close to the boy&rsquo;s features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory be, it&rsquo;s just a young kid!&rdquo; snorted
Lew. &ldquo;From the way he was fightin&rsquo; me, I
thought it was a wildcat at least! What&rsquo;s he
doin&rsquo; here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>Reno spat, wiped his mouth, and swore terribly
with his face close to Blackie&rsquo;s. &ldquo;You, now!
Who sent you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-N-Nobody,&rdquo; the boy managed to stammer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No tricks, now!&rdquo; warned the loathsome
tramp. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re alone, what are you doin&rsquo;
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie was terribly frightened, but kept his
head. These men were dangerous; he was alone
with them, miles from any help. They could not
guess that of all the people in the world, he alone
had witnessed the death of the hermit at their
hands. But if he admitted that he came from
Camp Lenape, they would wonder why he was
away from camp by himself, and would suspect
that there were others near. He must depend
upon his wits, now; and with the shadow of the
great lie at camp hanging over him, he felt that
one lie more or less would not matter now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the road, Mister Reno,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know you were here&mdash;I&rsquo;m bumming
around by myself, honest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tramp laughed nastily. &ldquo;On the road,
huh? Well, we need a kid about your size. Stick
with us, see, and you&rsquo;ll be rich some day. Frisk
&rsquo;im, Lew.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>The weak-chinned man called Lew was rapidly
going through Blackie&rsquo;s pockets and unstrapping
his belt. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in luck!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Grub and
a light and blankets! An ax, too; the kid can use
it to chop more wood for our fire. Look, Reno&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
have a regular banquet&mdash;peas and ham and
spuds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About time,&rdquo; yawned Reno, moving back to
the fire. &ldquo;Get a move on and dish up supper.
Blast my eyes if I ain&rsquo;t sick to death of livin&rsquo; on
fish and berries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lew permitted Blackie to get up. &ldquo;Well,
what did ya expect to live on while we was waitin&rsquo;
for the Big Job to blow over&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began, but
Reno stopped him with a hasty gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up! If the sheriff was to hear ya say
that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he threatened. Lew turned away,
muttering, and with Blackie&rsquo;s hand-ax chopped
open the can of peas and began cooking the meal
at the fire.</p>
<p>Blackie, unharmed for the present but stripped
of his supply of food and all his equipment, was
allowed to sit in a corner and wonder how he
could get out of his plight. Escape for the
present was impossible; he was too closely
guarded to get out of the hut, and even if he
did so, he would be lost in the dark wilderness
where every horror in the world might lurk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>The supper cooked, the two tramps set to in
surly silence and gobbled up every scrap of food
Blackie had brought. He did not dare ask for a
share, but hungrily watched them devour the
meal to the last morsel. Reno finished first,
wiped his greasy mouth on the back of his sleeve,
yawned loudly, took one of Blackie&rsquo;s blankets and
an old quilt he picked up somewhere, and laid out
his bed on the floor of the hut. His back was
against the low door, the only means of exit from
the place, and before turning in, he took the ax
and placed it under his ragged coat, which he
had doubled to serve as a pillow. Lew, leaving
the dirty dishes on the rough table, took the
remaining blanket and sprawled out on the floor
near the fire.</p>
<p>Blackie ventured a question. &ldquo;Excuse me,
Mister,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but where can I sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reno rolled over and glowered. &ldquo;A lot I&rsquo;d
care if ya never slept, ya dirty whelp! Shut yer
face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;you have all the blankets, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lew reached out a booted foot and kicked the
boy viciously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill ya if ya don&rsquo;t stow yer
gab!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Kids like you don&rsquo;t need
covers. If I hear any more out of ya, I&rsquo;ll jam
my foot in yer mush!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Blackie spent that unforgettable night squatting
on the hearth beside the fireplace. Now and
then he would drift off into a restless sleep,
troubled by dreadful dreams and startled awakenings.
His finger-tip ached continually, and the
nail had turned so black that he knew he would
lose it. He crouched miserably by the dead fire,
shivering from the damp chill that rose from the
pond and listening to the heavy breathing of the
two sleepers who barred his way to escape. His
teeth chattered as much from fear as from the
cold, for he could not forget that he was in the
terrible company of a pair of desperate murderers
who would twist his throat if they guessed
he knew anything about their crime. Once he
dreamed that he was back in Camp Lenape,
lying stretched out in his bunk at Tattoo, with
the stars bright over the pines, the friendly feel
of happy boys about him, and Wally sitting
beside the tent-pole reading vespers out of his
Bible. He woke with a start, and saw the two
ugly figures sprawled on the floor in the dim
firelight. Camp was behind him; he had left all
that, and was &ldquo;on the road.&rdquo; His cheeks were
wet; he had been crying softly to himself in his
sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>Gray dawn came at last. The two hoboes
roused themselves, and permitted Blackie to wash
his face and hands at the edge of the pond,
making fun of him for a delicate greenhorn as
they watched him. Shortly after, Reno disappeared
into the woods and after about an hour,
returned with a hat full of huckleberries, upon
which he and Lew breakfasted, neither offering
any to Blackie nor allowing him to find any for
himself. He was not out of the sight of one of
them during that whole dragging day. Save for
a muttered curse or a blow on the head, they
treated him as though he did not exist. The men
played with a grimy deck of cards most of the
morning, making large wagers against each other
and swearing blasphemously when they lost,
although the boy could not see that either of them
had a penny to win or lose. Around noon, as
near as Blackie could judge, Lew took a fishing
line and rowed out upon the pond in the leaky
old boat. He was gone for several hours. Reno
spent the time chewing tobacco and playing a
game of solitaire, or else snoring with his back
against the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Lew returned from his fishing expedition
empty-handed and in an ugly humor, and conferred
with the older tramp in muttered whispers.
Blackie was driven to the other end of the small
hut while they spoke, but listened as hard as he
could and managed to catch a word now and
then. Once he heard distinctly the phrase,
&ldquo;Flatstone Creek,&rdquo; and again, &ldquo;the kid can do
it.&rdquo; At the end of the talk, Reno rose angrily
and shouted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of yer snivelling like a
yellow cur! The whole thing has all blown over
by now&mdash;anyways, they haven&rsquo;t anything on us
to prove we done it!&rdquo; He began stamping out
the fire, rolled the blankets in an ungainly bundle,
and stuck the ax in his belt. Lew also made up
his blankets, to which he attached the flash-lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you kid!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;grab these bundles
and tote &rsquo;em for us. We&rsquo;re clearin&rsquo; out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This completed the preparations for departure.
Leaving the hut in a litter, with the door hanging
open, the two tramps led the way north around
the edge of the pond, followed by Blackie, who
stumbled along blindly under the burden of the
blankets and quilt and the lantern. Reno led at
a lazy gait, turning west after the end of Black
Pond was rounded and strolling through the
forested ridge for about three hours. At each
step Blackie grew more weary; he was, after
more than twenty-four hours of fasting, almost
ready to keel over with starvation. He was only
allowed to drop his bundles and rest a few
minutes now and then, when the men felt like
stopping. He had no idea where the hoboes were
going or what they intended to do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>At sundown, Reno called a halt. Blackie wondered
if the mountain would ever end. He threw
down the blankets and fell upon them wearily;
but to his surprise the two tramps lay on their
faces and peered out westward through a clump
of bushes. His curiosity overcoming his fatigue,
Blackie crawled over to their side, dodged a kick
from Lew, and looked in the direction Reno was
pointing with outstretched arm.</p>
<p>They were on the edge of a steep bluff fronting
on a pretty little green valley in the center
of which ran the silver ribbon of a brook. Beyond
rose, purple-clad, a low range of hills that Blackie
judged might fringe the Delaware. He was sure
the creek below must be the Flatstone&mdash;they had
been heading into the sunset for the past hour.
To the boy, enslaved by the loathsome vagrants
and unable to escape from their abuse and dangerous
company, the peaceful valley looked like
a promised land. Green, cool pastures spread on
each side of the brook, where cattle grazed, fat
little cows looking small enough, viewed from the
grim cliff, to have come out of a toy Noah&rsquo;s ark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Almost under them, at the base of the steep
mountainside, a white farmhouse lay near an
orchard of gnarled apple trees fronting on a yellow
dirt road running north and south. Across
the road was a rambling red barn, a farmyard
full of chickens, and the remains of an old lime-kiln.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the place I saw yesterday,&rdquo; said Reno.
&ldquo;Nobody there at night but the old guy and his
wife&mdash;the hired man lives up at the Center. I
found out that much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m starved,&rdquo; muttered Lew. &ldquo;How long
have we got to wait?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, these hicks go to bed early. If we wait
a couple hours, they&rsquo;ll be so much asleep you
couldn&rsquo;t wake &rsquo;em up with a cannon. We&rsquo;ll take
anything they got, and then beat it over to
Pennsylvania for a while. Lots of good places
across the river where we can lay low&mdash;this district
will be gettin&rsquo; too hot to hold us pretty
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing further was said for some time.
Smoke curled from the chimney of the farmhouse;
evidently the people inside were eating
dinner. A hearty country meal it would be,
Blackie thought, and his mouth watered as he
visioned smoking joints of meat, thick bread and
jam, rich creamy milk, golden-crusted slabs of
pie, corn and squash and pickles and beets, chocolate
cake&mdash;&mdash; He tried to pass the time thinking
of all the dishes in the world that he liked;
but soon had to stop because of the clawing pangs
of hunger that gripped him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>Reno and Lew lay watching the house like
wolves awaiting the coming of night before attacking
a defenseless sheepfold. Once a horse-drawn
buggy with one occupant passed along the
road, driving away from the Center that showed
dimly as a cluster of white houses and a church
tower to the north, where a bridge spanned the
stream. The sun disappeared; a few lights
blinked forth in the house below, giving it a
cheerful, friendly look amidst the mysterious
dark of the valley.</p>
<p>Blackie, left to himself, thought of nothing
but the chances of escape from the ugly pair he
had been thrown in with by the fortunes of the
road. If he could squirm away unnoticed, and
make a sudden dash down the side of the cliff, he
might get clear and find his way to one of the
houses in the valley. He was more than willing
to risk a broken ankle in the dark to win free of
the tramps. He rolled over as quietly as he
could, and began to worm his way across the
ground; but he made the mistake of putting his
weight upon a branch which snapped and gave
way beneath him, and Reno jumped up and
caught him by the collar with a snarl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;No tricks like that, my hearty!&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;Try that again, and you&rsquo;ll be black and blue for
a month! I&rsquo;ll skin ya, so I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie bowed his head under a rain of blows
that stunned him and made his ears ring. He
lay quietly after that, and did not move until,
after about an hour, the two men rose to their
feet with an air of determination. By this time
the lights in the farmhouse below had disappeared,
one by one; evidently the inhabitants
were all fast asleep. Reno led the way to the
left, picking his path by the aid of Blackie&rsquo;s
flash-lantern shielded under his coat; Blackie
followed, still stumbling beneath the weight of
the blankets; while Lew brought up the rear,
cursing softly when he stumbled on the treacherous
ground. They picked their way down the
steep slope of the mountainside, and after half
an hour of slow going, came out on the dirt road
near the barn. Here Reno snapped off the light,
and without even a moon to guide them the
tramps, like the thieves and night marauders they
were, sneaked cautiously through the orchard
until they reached the back of the farmhouse, and
stopped a few yards from the low cellar-door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>Here they paused for a brief consultation, and
then Reno crept toward the house, while Lew
watched him, meanwhile holding Blackie&rsquo;s arm in
a vise-like grip. No sooner had he vanished in
the direction of the house than the night was full
of the rousing bark of a dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse the luck&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Lew; but on the
instant the bark died away in a blood-curdling,
stricken howl; and afterwards there was silence
again. He listened in a strained attitude, still
clutching Blackie, who could hear his heart beat
so loudly that it seemed as if the inhabitants of
the house must hear those throbbing thumps between
his ribs and waken in alarm. Finally Reno
came back to them, moving like a shadow in the
starlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all clear!&rdquo; Blackie heard him whisper
hoarsely. &ldquo;The watch-dog heard me and almost
give the show away, but I cut his throat right
quick. I tried all the doors and windows, and
everything is tight as a drum&mdash;but there&rsquo;s a little
window in the kitchen that the kid might be able
to get through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send him along,&rdquo; said Lew. &ldquo;Does he know
what to do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d better know!&rdquo; whispered Reno sharply.
&ldquo;Listen, kid&mdash;ya got to help us. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to
boost ya through a window into the kitchen, and
you pass out all the grub you can find. While
I was around lookin&rsquo; at the windows, I found a
gunny-sack they use for a doormat, and we can
stuff it full of grub and take it with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but that&rsquo;s stealing!&rdquo; exclaimed Blackie.</p>
<p>Reno grasped his throat swiftly, and choked
the words in the boy&rsquo;s throat. &ldquo;Shut yer trap&mdash;do
ya want the whole house down on us? And
what if it is stealin&rsquo;? Ya ain&rsquo;t above that, are
ya, ya little ladylike brat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what if they catch me in there?&rdquo; moaned
Blackie through his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya better not let them catch ya, that&rsquo;s all.
But let me tell ya, it&rsquo;d be a sight better to have
the old farmer catch ya and put a shotgun full
of buckshot into ya than to come back to me
without a pile of grub!&rdquo; There was an edged
threat in his voice, and Blackie did not dare say
another word. If only he had stayed at camp
and obeyed the rules, he would not now have to
choose between robbing a house and being beaten
within an inch of his life by a murderous tramp!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>He allowed Reno to push him around to a
small, high window at the rear of the house.
&ldquo;There it is, kid,&rdquo; whispered the man in his ear,
&ldquo;and if ya see anything else worth takin&rsquo;, pass
it out to me!&rdquo; He lifted the boy to the ledge,
and Blackie fumbled with the catch. The window
opened outwards with a slight creaking
noise, leaving an aperture about half a yard
square. Making no further protest, which he
knew would be useless, Blackie squirmed through
after some trouble, and lowered himself slowly
into the silent kitchen of the sleeping house. He
had a new plan in his head now, and permitting
himself to be pushed inside the farmhouse was a
necessary part of it. It was his duty to rouse the
owner of the farm and warn him of the danger
lurking without. If there was a telephone in the
place, perhaps help could be speedily summoned
in time to capture the murderers outside; if not,
at least the house could be barricaded and the
tramps driven off. The farmer would give
Blackie shelter for the night, he hoped, and anyway
he would be free of the domination and driving
of the two vagrants; but unless the farmer
was awakened with care and quickly comprehended
what Blackie would tell him, he might
misunderstand and take the boy for a robber before
he could explain. Nevertheless, Blackie felt
that he must carry out his plan no matter at what
danger to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>He found himself in a sort of pantry leading
off from the spacious farm kitchen. A low red
fire still glowed in the stove, and he could make
out the walls lined with jars and cans and boxes
and cooking utensils of all kinds. A low hiss
from the window warned him that Reno was still
on the lookout. He would have to work rapidly.</p>
<p>Looking about him hastily in the dull light, he
found a door that seemed to lead to the other
parts of the house. Tiptoeing across the uncarpeted
floor one careful step at a time, he reached
the door and entered a long hallway. This he
followed for a yard or two, feeling his way along
the wall, until his hand touched a railing that
seemed to be part of the front stairs. He would
have to climb those stairs to reach the bedrooms.
He advanced one foot cautiously, and was just
climbing the first step, when a loose board in the
floor creaked with a sickening noise. It sounded
to the terrified boy like the crack of Doom.</p>
<p>Instantly his feet were knocked out from
under him as a heavy body leaped at him like a
football tackle, and he fell with a toppling crash
to the floor. Someone was upon him, holding
him in a resistless clutch! The wind was knocked
from his lungs, and he gagged and fought for
breath. The stabbing glare of a flashlight hit his
eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>Then the strangest event of all that strange
night happened. His unknown assailant gave a
little whistle of surprise, and broke forth into
speech. Only one word, but that word the boy&rsquo;s
name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flashlight twisted around; the stranger was
showing it upon his own face. Blackie gasped,
and almost shrieked with relief. The person who
had captured him in that dark, lonely farmhouse
was his own tent leader, Wally Rawn!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">THE SPRING-HOUSE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Wally! What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wally Rawn relaxed his iron grip and
helped Blackie to his feet. In the glow of the
flashlight the boy could see that Wally was fully-dressed
in corduroy trousers, blue flannel shirt,
and high woodsman&rsquo;s boots with laces dangling.
The councilor must have thrown his clothes on in
a hurry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might ask the same of you, Blackie,&rdquo; he
said with a slight grin. &ldquo;Have you become a
burglar all of a sudden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words recalled Blackie to his mission in
the farmhouse. &ldquo;Shh! Not so loud&mdash;they&rsquo;re still
outside!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s outside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two tramps! They&rsquo;re the ones that
killed poor old Rattlesnake Joe, and they made
me climb in the window to steal some food for
them. The older one stabbed the dog outside so
he wouldn&rsquo;t wake the house, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>Wally pursed his lips in a low whistle. &ldquo;So
that&rsquo;s who shut up the dog so suddenly! The
barking woke me up, and I thought I&rsquo;d prowl
around here and see what was happening. You
say these men are&mdash;murderers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;the sheriff is after them! Don&rsquo;t let
them catch me again, Wally! They kicked and
beat me all the time, and wouldn&rsquo;t let me have
anything to eat, and I&rsquo;m scared of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry&mdash;they can&rsquo;t get in here. But if
the sheriff wants these men, we might have a try
at capturing them. You say they&rsquo;re waiting for
you outside? Well, you might be able to get
them to bite on the hook. Are you game to take
a chance on locking them up where they belong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie&rsquo;s face fell. &ldquo;Why, sure, I&rsquo;ll try if
you help me. But how can I catch them? They&rsquo;d
kill me in a minute if they thought I was giving
them away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wally considered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; he exclaimed
softly. &ldquo;Listen&mdash;out there in the orchard there&rsquo;s
a spring-house where the farmer&rsquo;s wife keeps butter
and meat and stuff to cool. I remember it
has a strong lock on the door. If you could get
them in there, and snap the bolt on them, we
could hold them there until Kingdom Come.
It&rsquo;ll be touch-and-go with you if you can&rsquo;t get
them inside, but a pair like that should be under
lock and key as soon as possible. Will you try?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Blackie nodded. &ldquo;If you think that&rsquo;s the best
way&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. I&rsquo;ll wake up the old man, and we&rsquo;ll
be on the lookout at an upstairs window to protect
you in case the scheme doesn&rsquo;t work. We
can&rsquo;t show ourselves or they&rsquo;ll get suspicious and
we&rsquo;ll never have the chance again. Now, skip
back to the kitchen&mdash;they&rsquo;ll be wondering where
you went. Good luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wally began to tiptoe silently up the stairs,
and Blackie hastened back down the hallway to
the kitchen. On his way to the pantry window he
grabbed two or three jars of preserved vegetables
and a loaf of bread. He found Reno at the window,
almost crazy at the delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What took ya so long, ya little fool?&rdquo; he
raged under his breath. &ldquo;I thought I heard
noises inside, and thought ya were bagged for
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie handed out the jars. &ldquo;I was just
looking around for grub, Mister Reno,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t very much here&mdash;at least I can&rsquo;t
find it in the dark. This is all I saw.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>Reno grew ferocious with anger. &ldquo;Well,
that&rsquo;s better than nothin&rsquo;&mdash;but after all our trouble,
all ya could get was a mouthful! I&rsquo;ll fix you
for this later! Come on, climb out&mdash;don&rsquo;t stand
here jabberin&rsquo; all night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He helped the boy out through the narrow
window, and together they crept back to where
Lew was standing guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any trouble?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, the brat couldn&rsquo;t find enough to make
a lunch for a flea.&rdquo; Reno held out the jars and
the bread. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to try this game somewheres
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disgruntled, he led the way back through the
orchard toward the road. Blackie could barely
make out the white-washed side of the spring-house
to their left. He plucked Reno&rsquo;s ragged
sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I bet that place is full of grub! Let&rsquo;s
have a look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reno turned with a sneer. &ldquo;Go and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie knew that if he argued, it might breed
suspicion. He waded through the tall grass to
the low door and felt its rough face with his
hand. Sure enough; the outside bore a strong
bolt. As he opened the door, a draft of chill,
damp air came forth, mingled with the smell of
fresh cream and cheese. He stumbled in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>It was the usual type of country spring-house.
In the center bubbled up a rill of icy water that
was contained in a deep stone basin, filled with
tall cans of milk. The two men, attracted by
Blackie&rsquo;s easy entrance into the place, followed
him quickly, and found him busily gobbling a
generous chunk of apple pie, washing it down
with milk from a pitcher at his elbow. Hungry
as he was, however, Blackie had not lost sight of
the deed he had to do; it was part of his plan
to entice the men inside. Lew rose to the bait,
and began seizing foodstuffs with both hands;
but Reno cautiously stood square in the doorway,
covering the retreat. His mouth full, Blackie
pushed past him, stuffing cookies into his pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass the stuff out, Lew,&rdquo; Reno was saying
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stick it all in our bag here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie had meanwhile gained the outside, and
stood facing the back of the man in the doorway.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go in too, Mister Reno?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;You might miss something if you
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in his tone made the man whirl
about suspiciously. &ldquo;What do you mean, you
little roach? If you think you can&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>Blackie saw his only chance, and took it. With
a sturdy rush, he butted against Reno&rsquo;s legs. The
tramp, caught off balance, grabbed at the doorway
to right himself, and Blackie, with all the
force of his body behind it, plunged his doubled
fist into the man&rsquo;s stomach. It was a lucky blow
that landed right on the solar plexus, and for a
moment Reno was paralyzed. He gave a pained
grunt and keeled backwards into Lew, who fell
over a tall milk-can and tumbled sidewise into
the pool of icy water. Before either of them
could flounder to their feet, Blackie had slammed
the strong door and shot the bolt upon his
prisoners.</p>
<p>He sat down in the trampled, dewy grass, overcome
with the reaction that sets in after a trying
period of strain and excitement. And suddenly,
without knowing why, he began to laugh, laugh
until his sides hurt, unable to stop.</p>
<p>Wally Rawn came to him on the run from the
house, carrying a long-barreled shotgun in his
hands. He tested the soundness of the lock on
the spring-house door, and then clapped Blackie
on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neat work, son! You&rsquo;ve got them shut up
in there like a couple of sardines in a can. Say,
what&rsquo;s the matter with your funny bone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he looked so crazy!&rdquo; gurgled the boy.
&ldquo;I knocked the wind out of Reno, and he fell
over and pushed Lew into the water!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>From within the spring-house came an angry
racket. Reno must have scrambled to his feet
again and was shouting at the door; both men
were cursing a blue streak, and Reno was making
the most terrifying threats as to what he should
do if Blackie did not release the bolt on the instant.</p>
<p>Wally patted Blackie&rsquo;s arm soothingly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry your head about that.&rdquo; He
stepped to the door and called commandingly,
&ldquo;Listen, you inside there! I&rsquo;ve got a gun here,
and if you make one more sound I&rsquo;ll wing you
both! You&rsquo;re here to stay, and don&rsquo;t forget it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The serious depth of his voice must have impressed
them, for they maintained a puzzled silence
while Wally strolled back to Blackie with
a cheerful smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;ll stop their howling for a while.
Now, as I was telling you, I woke up the old
farmer&mdash;he was snoring away as peaceful as a
sheep&mdash;and now he&rsquo;s telephoning to Sheriff
Manders at the Center. The sheriff will be along
in his car as soon as he can make it, and until
then I guess these birds will stay in their cage.
They&rsquo;d better!&rdquo; he finished grimly. &ldquo;Now tell
me how you happened to be housebreaking here
in the dead of night in such bad company.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>Growing more calm, Blackie began his tale, relating
how on the night of the snipe hunt he had
overheard the two hoboes planning to rob the old
hermit, and how he had followed them and heard
the scuffle in the house and the scream which had
driven him to fly in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have told me or the Chief about
that,&rdquo; was Wally&rsquo;s only comment. &ldquo;It would
have saved a lot of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was too scared,&rdquo; confessed Blackie, &ldquo;and
besides it all seemed like a dream that couldn&rsquo;t
be true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told briefly how he had fallen in with the
tramps again at Black Pond, and how they had
later forced him to enter the house to plunder it.
When he had finished, Wally said nothing for a
while, but shook his head once or twice in somber
amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;guess after all these
adventures you won&rsquo;t mind going back to old
Lenape for a rest. I&rsquo;ve come to take you back
to Tent Four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;how did you know where I was? Why
are you here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know where you were, but I had a
pretty good guess. You slipped away from
camp, and I figured it was up to me to catch you
again. The Chief sent Mr. Lane in the car toward
Elmville to look out for you along the road
to the railway, and there were quite a number of
fellows scouting around for your tracks on the
campus. I wasted some time after supper down
at the south end of the lake, thinking you might
have headed that way toward home, and it wasn&rsquo;t
until this morning that I got the brilliant idea
that you would head right into the big timber for
a while. I found your trail up on the ridge, and
believe me, you hit some pretty rough going in
spots! Right in the middle of a swamp I found
a hat with your name on it, stuck in some bushes;
and then I knew my guess was right. But after
clawing my way through a regular jungle of
rhododendrons I lost your track, and naturally
thinking you would make for Newmiln, I raced
over to the Center. I had no idea you would
swing down into Black Pond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do then? Gee, you must have
been a wizard to follow me that far!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;I spent the rest of the day sweeping the Flatstone
valley for traces of you; I knew that if you
had passed this way somebody must have seen
you. When I got no news, I came back over this
side and the old farmer&mdash;his name&rsquo;s Jacob
Woods, and he&rsquo;s a friend of mine; I brought a
group of bikers over here last year&mdash;he offered to
let me stay here to-night and to go back into the
mountain with me in the morning to look for you.
He was telling me tales of lost hunters and mysterious
accidents back in these hills until I almost
went out to look for you with a lantern. It was
just a crazy coincidence that your hobo friends
decided to pick this house for their midnight robbery&mdash;but
I&rsquo;m glad I was the one that hopped
on you in the dark; somebody else might have
been rough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie had been drinking in every word.
&ldquo;Say, Wally,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;those tramps are awful
quiet. I wonder if they&rsquo;re up to anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; Wally, with his gun held at
ready, circled about the little stone building warily,
and was just in time to see Lew, the weak-chinned
younger tramp, sticking his head through
an aperture he had made by removing a stone
where the overflow from the spring found its way
out. &ldquo;Get back there, you!&rdquo; shouted Wally.
He pretended to aim a kick, and the startled
hobo, who had counted on tearing away the stones
and escaping by the back way, withdrew his head
so speedily that he bumped it. Wally closed the
opening with several rocks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>The sound of an auto horn from the road made
Blackie jump. &ldquo;That must be the sheriff!&rdquo; cried
Wally. &ldquo;Hi! Over this way, Mr. Manders!
Over here in the orchard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three men came tramping across through the
grass, two of them carrying rifles. The taller of
them Blackie recognized as the man who had been
conferring with the Chief on that fateful rainy
Tuesday when he had fought with Chink and
smoked with Gallegher. It was Sheriff Manders,
and he pulled out two pairs of handcuffs while
Wally was explaining things to him. Another
man he introduced as his deputy, a rugged farmer
with red chin-whiskers showing in the light of
the lantern he carried. The third, garbed in a
pair of overalls hastily donned over his night-clothing,
proved to be Mr. Woods, owner of the
farm, who since telephoning had been watching
at the roadside to direct the officers of the law
as soon as they arrived.</p>
<p>The sheriff heard Wally to the end, and then
turned to Blackie. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a real smart boy,
if what Mr. Rawn says is true. I&rsquo;ll be over to
your camp-ground later and get your affidavit on
all you&rsquo;ve told him; and likely you&rsquo;ll be wanted
at the trial.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>He stamped over to the door and knocked upon
it loudly. &ldquo;In the name of the law, I call upon
you to submit to arrest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the door was flung open, two cowed and
shaken vagabonds shambled out to face the weapons
of Wally and the officers. Their short imprisonment
had broken what spirit of bravado
they possessed, and under the watchful eyes of
the law they appeared as a brace of craven and
revolting blackguards caught in the midst of
crime. They submitted to being handcuffed, and
were bundled off toward the car in short order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you and see these fellows safe in
jail,&rdquo; volunteered Wally. &ldquo;No&mdash;you won&rsquo;t be
needed, Blackie; you&rsquo;ve done more than your
share this night. You just trot off to bed with
Mr. Woods here, and forget all about everything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>He disappeared after the two prisoners and
their guards, leaving Blackie with the aged
farmer. The latter led Blackie back to the house,
where his wife was fussing about the kitchen in a
faded red wrapper, stirring up the fire and raising
a most tantalizing smell of cooking. Mr.
Woods, with rare forbearance, did not bother
Blackie with questions, but every now and then
he caught the farmer looking at him with a puzzled
frown, shaking his head and muttering to
himself, &ldquo;Wal, who would have thought it?&rdquo;
His wife mothered Blackie, making him wash his
face and hands and seating him at the table,
where she piled hot food before him and watched
him gorge himself on sausage and fried potatoes,
pressing him to eat more pie and cookies until he
felt as though his eyes must be bulging with repletion.
When he could eat no more, she packed
him off upstairs to bed, and left him with a gentle
good-night. He undressed, almost dozing off
once or twice in the process, climbed into a high
four-poster bed, and lay snugly stretched out
under a brilliantly-colored old-fashioned crazy
quilt. He fell asleep as soon as his head touched
the pillow.</p>
<p>A short time later Wally returned and woke
him to say that he had seen the tramps safely
under lock and key in the jail at Newmiln Center,
and that he need not worry any more. Blackie
hardly heard the words before he was asleep
again. Wally blew out the lamp and crawled in
beside the sleeping boy, and once more all was
peaceful in the farmhouse at the foot of the
mountain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">THE LAST RACE</span></h2>
<p>Blackie and Wally were up at the first
crack of dawn; it was to prove an active day
for them, and they had no mind to get a late
start. After a hearty breakfast provided by Mrs.
Woods, they took the road south on foot. The
grateful farmer offered to harness his team and
drive them back to camp, but Wally knew that
he was needed to tend his stock, and courteously
refused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take the road down the valley and over
the mountains,&rdquo; explained Wally as the two
hiked side by side down the yellow road. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a bit longer than straight over the ridge, but
we&rsquo;ll avoid a lot of tough going, and save time in
the long run.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>Blackie was not sorry to be tramping along in
Wally&rsquo;s company on that bright summer morning.
His clothing had been neatly brushed and
cleaned by the farmer&rsquo;s motherly wife, and his
rescued blankets were strapped over one shoulder.
The sky was a lustrous, enamelled blue; the
fields and thickets sparkled with dewdrops; and
a cheerful chorus of birds chirruped a marching
song for them. The way led down the valley of
the Flatstone, running on a wooded height above
the wandering creek. Occasionally they passed
orchards and farmhouses, lazy in the sun; once
they climbed a spur of the hills and looked down
upon a great red mill, with a plashing race of
water leaping down through the dripping teeth
of a clacking wooden wheel. Several times they
were passed by farmers driving wagons or cars,
but always they were heading the opposite way,
toward the Center; and the two hikers were not
fortunate enough to get a lift. As they went
they chatted gaily, and all the grim hours of
Blackie&rsquo;s flight and bondage seemed like the half-remembered
fragments of a nightmare.</p>
<p>By ten o&rsquo;clock they had reached the crossroads,
beside a steepled little schoolhouse with a yard
overgrown with weeds, and halted several minutes
before turning eastward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;This route is longer than I thought,&rdquo; observed
Wally. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re only about half-way back
to Lenape now, and we still have the hardest part
of the journey ahead. I thought we might be
back in camp by this time. You see, to-day we
hold the big regatta and water-sports. Every
fellow in Camp Shawnee will have come down
from Iron Lake to compete with our swimmers
and divers, and I should be on hand to take the
entries and run the meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my fault you&rsquo;re not there now,&rdquo; said
Blackie. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t run away, everything
would have been all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t run away, two desperate characters
wouldn&rsquo;t be in jail to-day, facing trial for
murder,&rdquo; pointed out the leader. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
way of the world&mdash;there&rsquo;s no situation so bad
that courage and brainwork can&rsquo;t mend it, and
many a bad start has ended with a whirlwind
finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if I hadn&rsquo;t told a lie in camp, I
wouldn&rsquo;t have been kangarooed and would never
have left, and would never have found Lew and
Reno up in the mountains. But all the same, I&rsquo;m
done with lying&mdash;forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a peach of a resolution to make,&rdquo;
agreed Wally. &ldquo;Lying is either cowardly or
silly, and a Lenape camper doesn&rsquo;t want to be
either. And now let&rsquo;s be off; we won&rsquo;t get back
to camp just by talking about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>He leaped to his feet and they trudged off up
the mountain road at a smart pace. Blackie&rsquo;s
short legs had some difficulty in matching the
mile-devouring stride of the councilor, but he
did not complain, although it had grown exceedingly
hot and dusty, and it seemed as if the succession
of ridges across which they passed would
never end. Each time they would surmount a
summit, Blackie told himself that it must be the
last; and each time he would find another belt of
road stretching on ahead and another ridge to
cross. A little after noon they sighted a fine-looking
farm in the center of the hills, and on the
shady porch sat a red-cheeked man with drooping
mustaches. He was clinking out a lively tune on
a banjo, but dropped the instrument when he saw
them approach, and called out a cheery hail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Mr. Rawn! Ain&rsquo;t seen you sence last
year! Come on in and talk things over&mdash;the old
woman&rsquo;ll lay a couple extra dishes for dinner. It
ain&rsquo;t often we have the honor of company for
meals, and we like to make the most of them!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>Wally accepted the invitation, and after he
and Blackie washed the dust from their faces,
they sat on the porch and chatted with the farmer
until the smoking hot meal was served. The
leader was impatient to be off, but the pleasure
of the farmer and his wife at having visitors was
so great that it was some time before he could
break away. The dinner was leisurely and
abundant, and afterwards nothing would do but
they must chat with the garrulous farmer about
every subject he could think of, from hog cholera
to philosophy; and he insisted on playing his
entire stock of old country tunes on his banjo
before they finally parted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not far now,&rdquo; said Wally as they again
took the road. &ldquo;The last ridge is only about a
mile ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This cheered the plodding Blackie a little, but
all the same it seemed as if that mile was the longest
in the world. At last they reached the summit,
and instead of another dreary stretch ahead
they were rewarded with an exhilarating prospect
of the lake below and the flat countryside
beyond in the direction of Elmville. As they
paused to get their breath, a bugle call trilled up
to them from the lodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down and wash your dirty neck&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
sang Wally, keeping time to the trumpet-call.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sounding Swim Call. That means they
must be starting the swimming meet! Hurry,
Blackie&mdash;it must be at least two o&rsquo;clock; everybody
will be streaking down to the dock. See
that bunch of fellows over in the baseball field?
That must be the gang from Camp Shawnee.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>The two broke into a run which took them past
the spring and down to the signal tower. Here
they left the road, which bent at right angles,
and plunged down the hillside through the green
woods, following the trail beside the pipe-line.
Inside of twenty minutes they were stumbling
into Tent Four, where they sat on their bunks
to catch their breaths.</p>
<p>They found the tent rows deserted; evidently
every camper was assembled down beside the
lake. Wally recovered his breath first, and urged
by the necessity of going on duty at the dock,
slipped out of his clothes and into his swimming
suit. Blackie, after five minutes&rsquo; rest, began to
undress slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not so crazy for a swim you want to
hustle right down now, are you?&rdquo; asked Wally in
surprise. &ldquo;You better take a nap, son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get in the
meet, Wally! It&rsquo;s my last chance&mdash;you know I
have to leave camp to-morrow; I&rsquo;m only signed
up for the first two weeks. And you&rsquo;ve put in a
lot of time teaching me the Australian crawl
stroke, and I want to show what I can do in a
real swimming meet. Will you enter me in the
distance swims and the high dive?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>The councilor grinned. &ldquo;You sure are a glutton
for punishment! I wouldn&rsquo;t think, after the
last couple of days, you&rsquo;d have steam enough left
for swimming contests! But I admire your
gameness, and I&rsquo;ll sure put your name down.&rdquo;
He buttoned the strap on his bathing suit, thrust
his feet into a pair of tennis shoes, and dashed off
down the path toward the dock, from the direction
of which came a confused babble of shouting
and cheering. The swimming meet was already
in full swing.</p>
<p>Blackie went down to the lake only a few minutes
later, meeting no one on his way. The boat
dock and the shore were lined with swimmers and
spectators; about a hundred of them were strange
boys and leaders, wearing the red arrowhead of
Camp Shawnee, who had hiked down from Iron
Lake to accept Lenape hospitality for the day
and contest Lenape superiority in the water. The
life-saving boats were stationed further out than
usual, and Wally Rawn, with a whistle about his
neck and papers and a megaphone in his hands,
was stationed on the upper deck of the tower,
directing the events, assisted by the chiefs of the
two camps.</p>
<p>The first person Blackie encountered as he
stepped on the dock was Ken Haviland. The
aide gave him a stare of contempt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he snorted. &ldquo;So you came crawling
back to camp just as I knew you would!
Well, you might just as well have stayed away.
What&rsquo;s the idea of the bathing suit? You needn&rsquo;t
think we want a fellow like you to represent us
against Shawnee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wally has entered me in the meet,&rdquo; said
Blackie stoutly. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t kick if he
thinks it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wally&rsquo;s running the meet, and what he says
goes,&rdquo; admitted Ken grudgingly, &ldquo;but as far as
the campers are concerned, you don&rsquo;t count.&rdquo;
He turned away, refusing to speak further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Third event&mdash;underwater swim, junior
class!&rdquo; came Wally&rsquo;s voice through the megaphone.
The six contestants, three from each
camp, lined up at the end of the dock and when
the whistle sounded took off with flat racing
dives. The spectators cheered as the boys hit
the water; and the wearers of the arrowhead gave
a happy yell as their contenders took first and
third places. Steffins of Lenape ran a close second
with a fast breast-stroke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the score now?&rdquo; Blackie asked the
boy next to him. It was Slim Yerkes, and he favored
Blackie with a stare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d keep quiet if I were you,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget you&rsquo;re still on the blacklist around
here.&rdquo; He moved off, and Blackie sat down
weakly on a rock on shore. He had hoped that
by this time the edict of the Kangaroo Court had
been forgotten and that he could once more speak
freely with his comrades; but since his return not
one of them had spoken to him in friendship or
asked about his adventures.</p>
<p>He did not try to talk with anyone again, but
sat where he was and watched the progress of the
swimming meet with dull eyes. The Shawnee
team was a good one; a red-headed, slightly-built
lad named Lawrence took honors in the junior
class in diving, winning several first places in
the form and fancy events, and a husky kid whom
his Shawnee camp-mates called &ldquo;Hobo&rdquo; starred
in the sprints. They both helped to give Lenape
the worst of it, and at the end of the junior contest
the score was Shawnee, 37; Lenape, 23.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>Blackie caught sight of Irish Gallegher among
the groups on shore, but did not want to speak
to him. The senior diving events were now
called, and Blackie answered to his name among
those competing in high-diving. There were
about seven contestants entered from each camp,
and every entrant was entitled to three dives.
They assembled on the upper dock platform,
where a runway and springboard jutted out over
the end of the piers. In this event Lenape,
thanks to Wally&rsquo;s careful training, was in its
glory and took all three places. Steve Link, who
was a member of the life-saving crew, took first;
Blackie, in spite of his weariness, won second;
and Terry Tompkins came third. Blackie had
conquered his tired muscles and performed a very
creditable back jack-knife dive, but not one of
his team-mates shook his hand or dropped him a
&ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; Disgruntled, he retired to his
place on the rock and watched the Lenape team
slowly shorten the difference in score as the
senior events progressed.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;funny dive&rdquo; came last of all, and was
won by Fat Crampton, the pudgy lion-hunter.
He had been entered at the last moment by the
joke-loving Sax McNulty, and his victory came
as a surprise to everybody, but most of all to Fat
himself. He had timidly approached the board,
for he was not used to diving in any form; and
while he stood at the end debating with himself
what to do, his foot slipped and he toppled heels
over head into the water. His arms became entangled
in his legs as he fell, and he came up with
such a pop-eyed, startled look on his puffy face
that the judges immediately awarded him the
blue ribbon, although he had to be pulled out by
a delegation of volunteer life-savers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>The diving events in the senior class were finished,
and the score stood somewhat closer, with
Lenape standing 42 against Shawnee&rsquo;s 48.
Wally summoned the contestants in the fifty-yard
dash, in which Blackie had not entered,
wishing to save all his power for the more demanding
distance events. A rangy, sandy-haired
youth with the emblem of the Junior Red Cross
on his jersey stepped forward and was hailed by
a volley of cheers from the wearers of the red.
&ldquo;Dunning! Show &rsquo;em how to do it, Dunning!&rdquo;
He was evidently their champion, and he had a
confident smile on his face which might betoken
bad news for the Lenape supporters.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Dunning did win the fifty-yard
with ease, although his triumph was offset by
Link and Gil Shelton, who took second and third
places for the Lenape side of the score. The
representatives of the green and white also took
first and second in the underwater swim, making
the tally read Shawnee, 52; Lenape, 50, with only
three more events yet to be contested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hundred-yard swim!&rdquo; came Wally&rsquo;s voice
hoarsely through the megaphone. &ldquo;Shawnee
team&mdash;Dunning, Coombes, Lipsky; Lenape
team&mdash;Haviland, Link, Thorne!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie rose and walked stiffly to the end of
the dock; he was more tired than he had thought,
for no boy can hike with a heavy pack through
mountain roads for seven hours and still hope
to be fresh and springy in a gruelling distance
swim the same afternoon. He lined up with the
six contenders, between the confident Dunning
and Ken Haviland. The latter twisted his mouth
when he saw Blackie beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still trying, huh? Well, let me tell you,
Thorne, I&rsquo;d rather lose the meet than have a fellow
like you help to win it&mdash;and every fellow in
Lenape thinks the same!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie said nothing, but a red tide of resentment
climbed to his brain. So that was what they
thought of him! But at least they couldn&rsquo;t say
he was a quitter; he would do his best in spite of
what any of them said! He clamped his jaw,
and stared out over the sparkling waters of the
lake, over the course that had been marked out by
two of the life-boats, trying to recall everything
that Wally had taught him about the crawl-stroke&mdash;trudgeon
kick, powerful overhand pull
with the arms, measured breathing once in four
strokes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ready&mdash;set&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shrill purl of the starter&rsquo;s whistle sounded,
and six lithe bodies cleaved the water. Blackie,
full of anger and determination, put every ounce
of his waning strength into his strokes, fighting
to keep his head and time his muscles scientifically.
He did not dare look around to see how
the other contestants were coming, although he
was aware of a sandy head driving through the
water a little to his left and half a length ahead.
The course seemed short, but a stiff hundred-yard
swim will try the power of even a swimmer in the
best of training. He headed for the line stretched
between the two boats, his arms moving over his
head in a steady rhythm that kept time with the
beat of his legs, his face buried in cool bubbling
water. He&rsquo;d show them! Summoning up his
last straining ounce of power, he spurted to win
ahead of the swimmer to his left, and passed him
just as the shadow of the life-saving boat fell
upon their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thorne wins!&rdquo; came the voice of one of the
judges from the boat. &ldquo;Dunning second,
Coombes third!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>There was an uneasy silence among the Lenape
supporters, but after half a minute there
rose a belated cheer from the wearers of the red
arrowhead, who were disappointed that their favorite
had not won, but who consoled themselves
with the thought that Shawnee was still in the
lead.</p>
<p>Blackie took his time paddling back to the
dock. He did not expect congratulations for his
victory; but he was now beyond the stage of
caring. All he had wanted to do was to show
Ken Haviland that he was game; and the taunts
of the aide had given Blackie just that extra
ounce of vitality that had enabled him to spurt
ahead of Dunning. He climbed unassisted to
the dock, and stood watching the next event,
breathing deeply to get his wind in preparation
for the concluding event of the meet, the two-hundred-yard
swim that was the most demanding
of all contests upon the grit and capabilities of
the racer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>Some thirty boys were lined up for the next
contest, a free-for-all marathon over a triangular
course that led around two boats stationed some
yards apart in front of the dock; and at the summons
of the whistle there ensued a scrambling
battle-royal for places in the water. Most of the
bunch dropped out before the first boat was
reached, but among the remaining swimmers
there was a desperate contest to see who would
touch the wharf first. The Lenape cohorts broke
into mad cheers when they found that their entrants
in this helter-skelter marathon had placed
first and third, and the yells of all the spectators
grew and swelled out over the water when it was
found that the tallies for the last two events had
brought the score to a dead tie, with 57 points
for each camp.</p>
<p>The excitement was at fever heat as the contenders
lined up for the final event of the afternoon&rsquo;s
sport, the two-hundred-yard swim. The
entries were almost the same as for the shorter
distance, except that Link had been replaced by
Soapy Mullins. Dunning, somewhat crestfallen,
eyed Blackie with a vengeful air, as if resolved
to wipe out the memory of his previous defeat.
Coombes, who had placed third in the hundred-yard
event, looked pale and tired. Blackie stole
a look at Ken Haviland, who was again ranged
at his side, but the aide paid no attention. Blackie
saw him feeling the right side of his abdomen
tenderly, and thought he caught Ken making a
slight grimace of pain; but the signal for ready
came at that moment, and Ken straightened his
body and gritted his teeth as the starter put his
whistle to his lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>Brr-r-r-r! The six racers took the water and
the gruelling contest began, with two hundred
pairs of eyes fastened upon their shining muscles,
sleek heads, and straining bodies. The last race&mdash;the
race upon which depended the camp championship
of the season, the victory of the green
and white or the red arrowhead! No wonder the
air was filled with cheers and shouts of encouragement!
Once or twice Blackie caught the
sound of his own name rising from that bedlam
of excited watchers. He smiled to himself, filled
with a great elation. He had whipped Dunning
before, and knew he could do it again. Turning
his head with a jerk, he saw that Coombes was
already out of the race, had dropped behind, too
exhausted to continue. Beside Blackie, the
speedy Dunning whipped through the water, followed
by Ken Haviland and Soapy Mullins and
closely pursued by Lipsky. It was to be a close
race, in spite of the distance.</p>
<p>Onward Blackie Thorne churned his way,
tossing diamond-like drops from his hair as he
surged through the water. Ahead he could see
the dipping life-boats that marked the end of the
journey. Tie score&mdash;if he nosed Dunning out
for first place, it was almost a sure thing that one
of the other Lenape contenders would finish
ahead of the slow-going Lipsky, and end the
meet with a slender lead of two points that
would, however, give Lenape the day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>Ken Haviland was shooting ahead, and was
now close on the flailing legs of Dunning.
Blackie, with his eyes on the goal, was slowly but
surely increasing his half-length lead over the
Shawnee favorite, when he heard a low cry that
made him turn his head and halt his even stroke.</p>
<p>Ken was in trouble. His pallid face was twisting
with pain, and his arms floated helplessly at
his side. &ldquo;Blackie!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Cramps! I&rsquo;m
done&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dunning forged ahead, either not hearing of
Haviland&rsquo;s plight or else, still smarting from his
defeat, determined that nothing should interfere
to lose him this last and decisive race. Blackie
held his stroke, and Dunning caught up with him
in an instant.</p>
<p>For only a split second did Blackie hesitate.
Two voices seemed to be shouting in his ears at
the same time, arguing against each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ken is out of it, but there&rsquo;s still a good
chance that Mullins will beat Lipsky for third.
Go ahead and win!&rdquo; counselled the first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Ken has cramps&mdash;he&rsquo;ll drown if you
don&rsquo;t help him!&rdquo; contended the other voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;He hates you&mdash;don&rsquo;t throw away your big
chance to win just on his account! He said himself
he&rsquo;d rather lose the meet than have you win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s sick! He needs you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A clock was ticking somewhere in his brain,
ticking off the fractions of seconds in which he
must make up his mind what to do. Already
Dunning was beyond him, plowing determinedly
for the goal. Blackie made his decision. In a
few speedy strokes he was by Ken&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold you up&mdash;don&rsquo;t struggle!&rdquo; he
shouted in the aide&rsquo;s ear, and put forth a supporting
arm. Ken&rsquo;s face was blanched and torn
with pain, and he floundered about helplessly,
the muscles of his limbs knotted in paralyzing
lumps, his abdomen gripped with shooting pangs.
Blackie knew that he must be very sick indeed.</p>
<p>Soapy Mullins passed them some yards to their
right, followed by Lipsky trailing unsteadily in
his wake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy!&rdquo; said Blackie. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get
scared! It&rsquo;ll pass off soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a sudden Ken&rsquo;s muscles relaxed, and he
found he could move his arms and support himself
somewhat. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; he gasped.
&ldquo;Did they stop the race?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>A voice through a megaphone from the boats
answered his question. &ldquo;Dunning wins! Mullins,
second; Lipsky, third. Shawnee wins the
meet&mdash;score, 61 to 59!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the shore came the wild hurrahs of the
victors, and a sportsmanlike cheer from the Lenape
campers for those who had vanquished them.
In the excitement of the race, few of the watchers
had noticed that Blackie had gone to the aid of
Ken, and most of them had assumed that the two
had merely dropped out, overcome by the cruel
demands of the contest.</p>
<p>Ken&rsquo;s face was a blank. &ldquo;But&mdash;but that&rsquo;s not
fair! We ought to run the race over again&mdash;you
would have won easy if you hadn&rsquo;t come to help
me, Blackie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie shook his head. &ldquo;The meet&rsquo;s over. No
use kicking up a fuss and having the Shawnee
bunch think we&rsquo;re a gang of poor sports who
start crabbing when they lose. It&rsquo;s our hard
luck, and we might as well take our medicine. If
you feel better now, come on and I&rsquo;ll tow you
over to the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">THE END&mdash;AND THE BEGINNING</span></h2>
<p>The campers from Iron Lake departed
northwards about five o&rsquo;clock in holiday
mood, singing their camp song as they hiked,
more than contented to have won the close-fought
victory in the water. Some of the Lenape tribe
accompanied them a mile or two on the road, and
were forced to swallow a lot of good-natured
chaffing about their defeat, which they felt
keenly.</p>
<p>Blackie did not go with them. He had helped
Ken Haviland ashore, and seen him carried off
toward the hospital tent and the ministrations of
Dr. Cannon; and then he returned to Tent Four
and dressed in a clean outfit. He was agreeably
tired, but the swim had braced him immensely,
and he was comfortable in body for the first time
since he had run away. His mind was far from
easy, however, as he answered the bugle&rsquo;s summons
and stood Retreat ceremony with the tent
groups. He was still in coventry; not a boy
spoke to him, and many were the black looks cast
in his direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>It was the same at supper. Wally presided
over a quiet table that night. Gallegher sat
gloomily next to the vacant chair that belonged
to Ken Haviland. Fat Crampton, with his usual
good humor, was attacking his food with gusto,
rather pleased with himself for winning a first
place in the diving; Guppy and Lefkowitz chattered
together now and then; but Slater could not
forget how easily Lenape might have held the
championship had things been a little different.</p>
<p>Once Guppy turned to Slater and said, &ldquo;Gee,
that fellow Dunning wasn&rsquo;t any slouch of a
swimmer, was he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was pretty good, all right&mdash;but he would
have been beaten in that last race if a certain guy&mdash;I
won&rsquo;t mention any names&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t yellow.
It would have won us the meet, too.&rdquo; Slater
looked meaningly at Blackie, who flushed and
gazed down at his plate, biting his lip to keep
back a bitter retort.</p>
<p>After the dessert, Wally leaned over to
Blackie. &ldquo;The Chief wants to see you in his
office, son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;right after supper. He&rsquo;s
got a friend of yours in there with him now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Wally.&rdquo; Blackie knew who that
friend of his was; a saddled horse was tethered
outside that could belong to no one but Sheriff
Manders. When the dismissal signal was given,
he went over to the office door with a pounding
heart, and entered at the Chief&rsquo;s cheery invitation.</p>
<p>The Chief nodded as he saw Blackie. &ldquo;Come
in, Thorne. You&rsquo;ve met Sheriff Manders, I hear.
He&rsquo;s ridden over to get your affadavit against the
two men who attacked Rattlesnake Joe. Just
tell him slowly everything that happened, and
don&rsquo;t keep anything back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sheriff had paper and pen before him, and
with a gentle kindliness asked Blackie many questions,
writing down the boy&rsquo;s answers in a round,
careless hand. The Chief said no word, but listened
with increasing attention as the tale of
Blackie&rsquo;s adventures was unfolded. When the
officer pronounced himself satisfied, he looked
over at the Chief with a quizzical air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind of a lot of trouble for a kid his size to
get into, eh? Well, you&rsquo;ve helped the state to
prosecute a pair of brutal criminals, young
Thorne, and I think I may venture to say
that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>The Chief cut in on his speech. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t
talk about that now, Mr. Manders, if you don&rsquo;t
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you say. Well, I&rsquo;ll be going now.
Thank you both. &rsquo;Night!&rdquo; He stamped out of
the office.</p>
<p>Blackie made no move to leave, but cleared his
throat huskily. He had the most distasteful task
in the world before him, the job of admitting that
he was a coward who had sought to shield himself
from punishment behind a lie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chief, I&mdash;I want to tell you something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, Blackie.&rdquo; The Chief&rsquo;s face betrayed
nothing of what he might be thinking.
&ldquo;They say that confession is good for the soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lied to you the other night. I was with
Gallegher when he broke the camp rule against
smoking, and I smoked too. I&rsquo;m sorry I lied,
and I&rsquo;m willing to take my punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what that means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. You can go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief nodded that the affair was ended for
the present, and Blackie left the little office. He
had done it. A great load was lifted from his
heart; he had confessed like a man, and things
were understood between the Chief and himself.
However painful might be the outcome, at least
he had cleared away the black stain on his conscience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>A busy crew of stage-hands was arranging
the lodge in the semblance of a theater, for that
night was to be given the musical show, &ldquo;Coo-Coo,&rdquo;
in which Sax McNulty and an imposing
troupe of camp talent were to perform for the
amusement of the campers, a few visitors from
the city, and some neighboring farmers. As
Blackie passed out to the porch, it was just growing
dusk. From the lake he could hear laughter
and shouts of gaiety; in spite of the afternoon&rsquo;s
defeat it was to be a night of merriment. Chinese
lanterns gleamed from the dock, which was
crowded with campers dressed in masquerade
regalia; boat-loads of boys in costumes ranging
from African wild-man to pirate were rowing
about amidst song and fun-making, watching a
canoe-tilting contest, at the end of which one
crew or another would be pushed over with a long
bamboo pole and precipitated into the water.
Blackie turned away and headed for the hospital
tent. There was little happiness in his heart, and
he did not wish to be reminded of the gaiety of
others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>Ken Haviland was sitting up in bed when he
arrived, and invited him in with a voice that
showed he had quite recovered from the mishap
of the swimming race. &ldquo;Sit down here on the
bed, Blackie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The Doc filled me up
with hot water and ginger, and I&rsquo;m as well as
ever, only he won&rsquo;t let me get up. It&rsquo;s too bad,
because I feel fine, and don&rsquo;t want to miss the
big show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great, Ken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? You look about as
happy as a corpse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, the guys in the tent are still jumping on
me because I didn&rsquo;t win the last race. Slater
called me yellow at supper, and all the others
thought I was, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they? Well, soon as I get out of here,
I&rsquo;ll fix that! Wait till they hear what really
happened; they&rsquo;ll be sorry they didn&rsquo;t have better
sense. By the way, I&rsquo;m passing around the word
that the Kangaroo Court decision is all off, and
we&rsquo;ve forgotten all about it. I&rsquo;m sorry for what
I&rsquo;ve been thinking of you all along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I deserved it, Ken. I&rsquo;ve been just a fresh
kid ever since I hit camp&mdash;I see it all now. I&mdash;I
guess the gang will be glad to see me go back
to the city to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>Ken leaned forward, and put his hand on
Blackie&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it! You&rsquo;ve
only been here two weeks, but you&rsquo;ve done a lot
for Lenape. I don&rsquo;t know what the Chief thinks,
but as soon as Doc Cannon lets me out of here,
the bunch is going to find out what kind of a hero
you really are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chief knows,&rdquo; said Blackie dully. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
going to square up with me in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie left the tent thinking of what the
morning would be sure to bring, and in a dejected
mood went down to Tent Four. It was dark and
deserted; the whole camp was now assembled in
the lodge, from which came down to him the
lively strains of music from the camp orchestra,
the overture of the show. The happiness of the
campers only emphasized his pangs of loneliness,
and he slowly donned pajamas and climbed into
his bunk. The strain of the day soon proved too
much for him, and lulled by the music, he drifted
off to sleep, from which he did not waken when
his tent-mates tumbled into their bunks when Call
to Quarters sounded at eleven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>Blackie woke in the misty dawn the next morning,
and softly, so as not to wake his slumbering
tent-mates, dressed in his city clothes and began
packing his blankets and stuffing his camping-kit
into his sea-bag. To-day he would leave Lenape,
leave the lake and the hills and go back to the
hot city. Well, that was the only thing to do.
He was in bad with the boys and the Chief, he
told himself; he had failed in almost everything
he had attempted to do. After two weeks of the
Lenape life, he was not any better a camper than
when he first landed in Tent Four. True, he had
won his honor emblem, but that was sure to be
stripped from him. He wore it on his jersey still,
buttoned under his coat; but he knew that he had
no better right to wear it than Gallegher had,
as everyone would soon discover.</p>
<p>Reveille blew before he had finished his packing,
and he continued making ready for departure
while the pajama crew went down for Indian
dip. He noticed that about a dozen other
boys, who were also leaving at the end of the first
section, were also getting into their unaccustomed
travelling clothes and stowing their camp things
into suitcases and bags. By the time Assembly
sounded, Blackie was ready to leave for the station
at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>He lined up with his comrades before the flagpole.
All during the ceremony of flag salute and
while the buglers were trumpeting Call to Colors,
his nervousness increased. He dreaded what was
coming; it was worse than a trip to the dentist.
The Chief was sure to speak this morning. In
a few moments he would be disgraced before all
the campers. He looked toward the end of the
line hastily. Little Pete Lister was standing
there with his drum strapped about his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attention!&rdquo; came the Chief&rsquo;s command. He
stood with dignified sternness before them, and
the files straightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackie Thorne, five paces forward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a stir among the campers as Blackie
marched forward with chin up, arms at his side,
and a set face. They, too, guessed what was
coming now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I hadn&rsquo;t said he was yellow yesterday,&rdquo;
whispered Slater behind his hand. &ldquo;That
kid&rsquo;s got nerve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sure has!&rdquo; responded Gallegher. &ldquo;I
know what he feels like now, and believe me, it&rsquo;s
no joke! But it was all my fault&mdash;I really
dragged him into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence in the ranks! Blackie Thorne, you
have admitted to me that you have been guilty
of conduct unbecoming to a Lenape camper, and
have signified your willingness to abide by whatever
punishment is inflicted. Is that right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie flushed, but looked his Chief straight
in the eye. &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;You will here, in the sight of all your comrades,
be stripped of the honor emblem which has
been made unworthy by your act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie braced himself, waiting; the Chief
stepped forward with the blade of a knife gleaming
in his hand. Now it was coming! He felt
the Chief pulling away his coat and cutting the
stitches of the green and white badge. The clattering
tattoo from Lister&rsquo;s drum was in his ears.
The Chief stepped backward, putting away the
knife. Now it was all over. Blackie made a
move to return to his place in line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay where you are, Thorne!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The campers started with surprise; they had
not anticipated this. Blackie waited, expecting
some further reprimand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;I still have another duty to do,&rdquo; announced
the Chief evenly. &ldquo;But first I want to tell a
story which some of you may have read in a book
by Victor Hugo, a book called &lsquo;Ninety-Three.&rsquo;
It tells there of an incident which happened on
board a French warship. Through the carelessness
of the chief gunner, one of the huge cannons
on the deck broke away from its chains, and
pitched about by the rough sea, rolled from one
end of the ship to the other like a monstrous
metal battering-ram on wheels, killing many
sailors who could not get out of its way, smashing
the other cannons that were to defend the
ship from the enemy, and battering the timbers
until the vessel was in danger of sinking. It
seemed impossible for the brutal rushes of the
gun to be checked; but one man, armed only with
a handspike and a rope, jumped down on the deck
and struggled to halt its mad career. It was the
chief gunner, the man who was to blame for the
deadly danger to the ship and her crew; and after
a superhuman battle in which he nearly lost his
life, he succeeded in overturning the cannon
and lashing it so that it could do no further
harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief paused a moment. Blackie was listening
in a daze, wondering what this tale could
have to do with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When all was safe again,&rdquo; continued the
Chief, &ldquo;the gunner was brought to be judged by
the general who commanded the ship. The general
first pinned upon the gunner&rsquo;s jacket the
cross of St. Louis, the medal for military merit,
as an award for his bravery in capturing the cannon.
He then ordered the man to be shot because
his negligence had endangered the ship. The
gunner was executed with the cross of honor on
his breast, rewarded for his courage and punished
for failing in his duty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>Again the Chief paused; the boys looked at
each other wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sooner or later all of us get our just rewards
for what we make of ourselves, as that wise general
knew. Blackie Thorne broke a camp rule,
told a lie to escape punishment, and ran away
from camp rather than face the consequences of
his act. But when you hear what other deeds he
has done, you may agree that he has wiped out
some of the counts against him. Yesterday he
threw away the glory of winning the swimming
meet for his camp in order to go to the assistance
of a stricken tent-mate, a boy whom he disliked;
and afterwards he did not mention anything
about his reason for dropping out of the race,
fearing to be a poor sportsman. The winning of
even a contest against Shawnee is, in my opinion,
nothing to be compared with the display of
bravery shown by Blackie in the water yesterday
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cheer rose from the campers, involuntarily
bursting forth from their lips. Excitement ran
high. Blackie listened, abashed by this sudden
turn of favor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;Blackie was again put to the test when he encountered
a pair of dangerous criminals who were
wanted by the law. With courage and discernment,
he captured those men at great risk to
himself. Now, although he did not know about
it, there was a reward offered for the person who
led to the arrest of these malefactors, and last
night the sheriff brought over to me a check for
three thousand dollars, which I am now presenting
to Blackie Thorne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief was unable to speak further; his
words were drowned in a torrent of cheers that
made the mountains echo. Somehow the command
to march was given, and the hungry horde
stamped off to breakfast, still shouting Blackie&rsquo;s
name to the skies.</p>
<p>Blackie stood bewildered, clutching the check
in his hand. Three thousand dollars! Wally,
who had left the line, put his arm around the
boy&rsquo;s shoulder and looked down into his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like being rich, Blackie?&rdquo; he
laughed. &ldquo;Does it feel funny at first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure does!&rdquo; exclaimed Blackie. &ldquo;Say,
when I think how happy my mother will be when
I tell her I can buy lots of things we couldn&rsquo;t
have before, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble to explain. By the way, when
the Chief told me about this check last night, I
sent a telegram off to your mother asking her
if you could stay for the rest of the season if she
didn&rsquo;t have to pay any more money. I didn&rsquo;t
break the news about your reward to her&mdash;you
can do that yourself&mdash;but just a little while ago
I got a wire from her, and she agrees that you can
stay at Lenape clear up to September! Six
weeks more of camp for you, Blackie&mdash;how does
that sound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; There was a lump in the boy&rsquo;s
throat as he looked out over the campus he
had come to love. Six weeks more of free, out-door
comradeship with Wally and the Chief and
the whole gang of good fellows! &ldquo;Say, Wally,
remember how you told me one day that there
was a treasure around here?&rdquo; He looked down
at the check in his hand. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t believe you
then, but I do now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackie,&rdquo; his councilor assured him solemnly,
&ldquo;you found that treasure right in your own heart&mdash;the
rich treasure of true Lenape spirit!&rdquo;</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
